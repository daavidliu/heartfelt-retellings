My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. \n\nWe were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. \n\n4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. \n\nMy friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. \n\nThe celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",

    "story": "Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. \n\nIn July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. \n\nIn March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. \n\nIn the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",

My depression was caused by burnout so how I got over it was taking a medical leave to grow as a person outside of work/school. Like a lot of people who enter college, I felt like my whole life leading up to college was just obsessing over academics and people pleasing. \n\nMy journey consisted of a ton of therapy, a cycle of self destruction and self reflection, figuring out who I want to be for myself. Usually that's something people have time for in college, but I don't find that to be true here heh. \n\nAnyway, even though my journey was very individual- I had to do the work on my own- I couldn't have had the capacity to do it without a support system. I think as a friend, the best thing you can do is 1. Listen and 2. Meet your friend halfway. \n\nWhat I found helpful was when my friends checked in with me but didn't press or become overbearing. They engaged and sympathized when I had things to rant about but didn't force it. They offered me their floor or shared food when they could but also kept their boundaries and limits. \n\nWhat made things worse from some people was asking me how I was doing every time they saw me and being awkward around me...like just because depressed doesn't mean I'm depressed 110% of the time, so don't act like I'm incapable of other emotions. Also obviously ditching would be bad, but no one did that to me thankfully. \n\nBut yeah, it's not your responsibility to save your friend from depression, it's really only something they can do themselves. It's more like when someone is sick with a virus and only their immune system can fight it, but you can buy them medicine, walk with them to the doctor, and feed them snacks while you watch Netflix together yunno?",

    "story": "My youngest son was to enter PS3 this year. It was both exciting and terrifying as I knew he is my last child and I had a mix of feelings. I wanted it to be wonderful, yet it was hard to let him go and know that he was moving on and progressing in life to an older more mature age for a young child. I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm and I had a positive attitude overall about everything. \n\nI was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well and I am very relieved. \n\nTwo days ago we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day, and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had. \n\nHe was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall. He was happy when I left him in the classroom. I am so relieved and thankful that this has been a relatively easy transition and hope it stays that way.",

We are both originally from the Pacific Northwest and about a decade ago we both had nothing and we flew across the country with almost nothing to our names to start our life on the east coast. She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. \n\n \n\nAbout 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. \n\n \n\nI remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. \n\n \n\nThat trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. \n\n \n\nWe made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us.

    "story": "I've been dealing with a chronic, \"incurable\" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. \n\nLooking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, \"New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese\" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. \n\nIt turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. \n\nBut why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",

I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her. \n\nI mourned at the lost time and the major events my mom would not be a part of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely. \n\nI remember just going into her room, and crying thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it. She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom.

    "story": "I almost killed someone last month. I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces.\n\nAnd then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me.\n\nThere was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone.\n\nMy bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.\n\nThe next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that. My family is broke but I didn't kill someone that day.",

In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actual apartment to start over in. \n\nI wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could no longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. \n\nNeedless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable.

Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. \n\nThe first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs! \n\nOnce my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. \n\nUnder this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. \n\nThis was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods.

    "story": "A good friend of mine recently died in a car accident. Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. \n\nIt made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, \"I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?\" which only made me more mad. \n\nAlthough I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. \n\nLater on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",

Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night I stopped reading them. The next morning they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. \n\nOur conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. \n\nWhat ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. \n\nIn the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens. ",

    "story": "3 months ago, I moved out of my old town into a new city. I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. \n\nLuckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Though I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. \n\nI made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. \n\nI was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. \n\nThe new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories.

I could not believe that I spent the last five years of my life working towards this day. During my time in university, I met many people of different backgrounds. Because of this I learned about many different cultures and became more culturally enriched myself. What makes this significant is the path it led me on today. Thanks to the many great people I collaborated with during university, I received an opportunity to work for a great company that embraces and supports diversity. \n\nThe day of graduation is one that I still remember as if it was just yesterday. The feeling of accomplishment, but also some sadness still lingers on until this day. During my last year, I got realy close to some people which is unusual for me. Many of the people I interacted with during my schooling were what i would consider acquaintances. However, these people I met I could actually call my friends. The reason for my sadness is that I knew that once I graduated, I would most likely not keep in touch as much as we did before. \n\nIn the end, we all went to school for one reason, to get a nice paying job. We didn't really go to school to meet new people; at least that's what it felt like. Anyways, the biggest thing I take away from this day is that all good things must come to an end at some point. I was counting down the days to graduation because I knew once it was over, that there would have to be a big change in my life; something I always feared. \n\nMost people would describe their graduation day with feelings of relief, happiness, and accomplishment. For me it was a bit different, almost the opposite. While the friends I made were probably the best part about going to school, would it even matter 5 years from now?

I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk. I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside. As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch. He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him. He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout. He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. \n\nThe next two days were awful. He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him. Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye.

It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. \n\nHe ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye. He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work. Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. \n\nIt ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye. My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed.

I'll at least have the memories of the museums and memorials for myself. \n\nIn terms of things that happened, we had many periods of silence while even being in the same room, and at times it seems she didn't want to be around me. As I could, I would go do my own thing so she wasn't getting upset, but it was painful to do so. Realizing you're not wanted isn't a fun experience. There was never a situation where she said I needed to go away, but it was made uncomfortable by the way she acted. \n\nIt's hopefully something that will heal with time, but I don't know that it will. It's causing me to look into new jobs so that I can remove myself from the situation.",

My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65. \n\nWhile at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion: the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition. For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the \"widow maker\" work better (it was 90% blocked). Within a few days, I was released. \n\nHowever, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days.

The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. \n\nA person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. \n\nI decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap and bring it home. I have bottle feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. \n\nI was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going to have a chance at survival. I stayed up all night feeding him goat's milk from a syringe every two hours. I kept him warm by placing a sock filled with uncooked rice that I heated in the microwave every 30 minutes or so. \n\nIt was a long night, but he survived! I was so happy!",

    "story": "I was driving home from the attorney's office with fresh keys in my pocket after I just signed the papers to close on my new home. The weather was beautiful and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back on to the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge. \n\nAs I was almost completely merged a felt a soft (extremely soft) bump and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right hand shoulder and pull over. \n\nAs I eventually pulled over the driver of the car got out and started yelling and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage. \n\nAs we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault. I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. \n\nAs things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay and then they left. \n\nLater on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point, that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging and they could get money out of the situation. \n\nNow when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.",

    "story": "At the age of 18 I had an abortion. The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me. The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on. I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so. \n\nMy mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant. When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out. \n\nThis was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side. To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact. \n\nI am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided. This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether.

It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. \n\nThe part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. \n\nAnyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. \n\nMy children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food.

I was told about this event about 3 months ago and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community. \n\nI did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success. \n\nAt the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. \n\nIn the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have.

    "story": "My girlfriend and I moved recently. We had been dealing with financial difficulties in our previous house. We were always pretty poor; I had a low paying job and she was unemployed, but it wasn't a problem before. The biggest issue was that we always had roommates before, but then they moved out. We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. \n\nAt a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments. It was a very stressful time in both of our lives. Through some stroke of luck, one of the members of my girlfriend's church was looking for new roommates; someone that was friendly and we could trust. Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. \n\nWe started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now.

    "story": "It was late summer and I was still in the local baseball recreational league for adults. The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. \n\nThe team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were a subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. \n\nWe had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. \n\nOnce the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. \n\nAt the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago.",

Recently I got a random thought that the thing I like to do now which even earns me some good money, happened just because I failed my exams. \n\nI knew about this thing since September 2020 and ignored it, I gave my papers in December that year, results came in February and I failed and gave again at the end of July. Having a good amount of free time in August 2021 I decided to finally look into it and since then it has changed me forever. Now if I would have passed my exams I doubt I could have even thought of this thing because I had other things to do in February and later got busy with other exams. \n\nAfter thinking this I realized more things, because of failing that exams and delaying my progress for 6 months I found so many better people and had so many great experiences which I would have not had if I cleared it 6 months ago, like there were covid restrictions 6 months before I did this so any chance of meeting new people at that time goes to zero. And my old self couldn't have even possibly imagined it, this thing I didn't even think was possible in real life and now that it's in real life its like 100 times better. I can't be more grateful for failing that exam. \n\nPros I have realized while thinking this way: \n\n1. Excited for the future even when going through bad times. \n\n2. Always trying to figure out how this bad things turn out to be good for me. \n\n3. Less complaining and more grateful. \n\nCons I have realized: \n\n1. You get lazy, won't work too hard, like what's the reason if it will turn out in my favor. \n\n2. Day dreaming a lot. \n\n3.

I remember my mom splitting two cans of speghettios and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she \"wasn't hungry\" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families. \n\nMy stepdad liked to bbq, nothing fancy. hot dogs, hamburgers, If it was a special occasion he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind and hers was better) and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate. \n\nKids would run around the neighborhood catching lightening bugs and 'causing trouble' while the \"cool teenagers\" smoke, drank and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the \"younger kids\" and the \"older kids\" so I could go play \"big sister\" then come hang out and be \"little sister\" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over) \n\nI just love remembering those days. On one hand I never had anything to myself and sometimes it really sucked.

At first it was a really hard hit because I didn't want my family to break apart but no matter what I could do it wouldn't change what's going to happen. It was difficult. \n\nShortly after my parents broke up (they never married) my dad had to find a place to live so he was still with us for a bit. Eventually he moved out and even though he said he's still my dad and we're still a family he never visited. He never called. He barely texts. He never came over for supper. None of it. We tried to be understanding because not even a few days after my parents broke up my dad's nephew passed away due to drugs and my dad practically raised him so it was like his son just passed away. \n\nWe gave him the space he needed but also reminded him he wasn't alone. Turns out he wasn't even alone in the first place. Barely two weeks after they broke up he found another woman and has been with her in secret until we found out randomly through Facebook. My mom was furious because he lied to us. He could've told us but he deceived us. \n\nThen my mom told me that the woman he's with used to be a drug dealer. My mom's been with my dad for 14 years and knows him so well. She said that in the photos of him and that woman he looks intoxicated and even my auntie agreed. So my dad is doing drugs and ignoring me and my mom. \n\nThis whole situation is messy and both me and my mom realized how abusive he was since he left and it's left me in quite the shock.

He said we'd get through this bump in the road. \n\nA month or so in, when he knew that I was looking for a pet, the vet clinic he works at got a kitten in off the streets.

The reason my mother has failed at raising me is because she has fed fear on me, my father couldn't care less about me so it's almost as if i were raised without a father. She would always tell me don't do that, don't go there, it's dangerous. Or when I was a little kid and was terrified by something like the end of the world, she and her relatives would make up stories about the world ending and everyone dying and they would laugh as I was terrified and crying. They found it funny. \n\nWhen I do open up to her most of the time we end up fighting and arguing because she cannot accept that she is wrong in any way. I had told her multiple times to find me a psychologist which she says that she'd take me there but never does, blames it on the work she has and how busy she is. Now I cannot deny the fact that my mother has given me freedom because I don't want to make her seem like a monster parent but rather an ignorant one who failed at parenting. Even though she pushes me sometimes on getting a job I think I have to heal myself first.",

All day every day for the past two-three months. It was honestly starting to fry my brain a bit. It also was making my self esteem really low and made me feel lonely. I'd see people get all these likes and comments and showing throwbacks of hanging with their friends before quarantine. \n\nBeforehand, when I was able to live my life and was only on the app for maybe 2 hours combined throughout the day, I hardly gave it thought. But now it just nags at me and I find myself stalking my ex or my boyfriend's ex or random girls who seem popular and naturally photogenic. It made me feel low and stupid for being so caught up on it. \n\nSo I decided to just delete the app for about a month. Maybe even longer if I feel better off. It was just generally distracting me and had no sustenance in it aside from constant memes and people posting their best selves. I've been on reddit more and it's a lot more positive with more information and things to explore. \n\nSo far I'm happy to be able to cut something that kind of is my generation's mental crack. My self esteem is going back up and my mind doesn't feel so hooked on just looking for social validation and something to consume. First day I deleted it, I kept tapping my phone where the app used to be and it's insane how it wires your brain. \n\nNow I've been watching more movies, going on walks, journaling more, and even made fried chicken today.

I have so much more energy now and I am so much happier in myself too. \n\nEarlier this month I also felt far enough into my recovery to begin to look for employment again after not being able to work for 4 years. I applied to a few jobs in the health sector and found out today that I have an interview next month to be a Medical Secretary! I cannot describe how delighted I am that I even got an interview.

Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. \n\nI became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. \n\nIn that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby.

But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come. \n\nThe accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road.

We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. \n\nThis vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. \n\nThere were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. \n\nEvery morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it.

I picked at it a few more times. \n\nThat evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. \n\nAfter everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying.

The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled \"no stopping any time.\" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. \n\nA woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, \"The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME.\" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. \n\nAn older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me.

It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. \n\nMy anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. \n\nWe talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.",

I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. \n\nShe tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. \n\nThe anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece of my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. \n\nI told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. \n\nI went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall. I looked at my angry face in the mirror and wondered why I allowed such a pathetic person to upset me so greatly. She wasn't worth it.",

I was already a nervous wreck, because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her \"Senior Walk\", where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying and it is over in 5 minutes. I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. \n\nMy plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. \n\nShe is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been her and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. \n\nShe is adjusting well to her new school schedule and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance.

And nobody around me seems interesting enough to me. Life gets boring. And frustrating. \n\nI am a frustrated person. I want to feel romantic love but I only feel it for my ex, and it is the slightest amount so I cling onto it. I don't know if I'm aromantic or something. It is so frustrating having to chase that feeling. My ex was the only one ever to give me a slight feeling of romance. I do not get crushes. I would never kiss someone, touch makes me cringe. \n\nBut I want the picture perfect life. Nothing will make me stop wanting a wife and family. And my ex is the only one I could possibly have it with. \n\nI am so lonely and I know it is just messing with my head. Nobody understands me. People think I'm weird and crazy. Everyone does. Nobody is here for me. Nobody knows who I really am. And I feel like I can't relate with anybody all of the time. People frustrate me so much yet I need them to fill some void in me. \n\nI worry. I distract myself with school, but each day I come home and it's the same. The feeling of dread. I hate myself. I hate everything. \n\nI've been less timid. Trying to be more approachable looking. It doesn't work. I put myself in situations to talk to people. We don't get past surface level stuff. \n\nI am trapped in this isolation. It gets me so mad. I am trying. I physically can't speak at times and I have to use hand gestures a lot. I can't speak! What else am I supposed to do?! My voice is wrong when I do manage to speak. It is not expressive or funny. People think I have no emotion and I am so serious. \n\nI just want to be normal. I am not normal. Something is wrong with me but I don't know what. \n\nI just want a real friend.

We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. \n\nToday when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he would love to take me there this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. \n\nFast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school. When he did call, my heart was practically pounding, but I was able to answer it on time. He's picking me up at 11 in the morning tomorrow, and I think I'm more excited than I've ever been. \n\nI wasn't so sure what to make of it, but he actually called it \"our date\" while we were on the phone, so I cannot get that out of my head now.

We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service.
