            "story": "June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. \n\nWe were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. \n\n4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. \n\nMy friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. \n\nThe celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",

            "story": "Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. \n\nIn July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. \n\nIn March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. \n\nIn the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",

He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. \n\nThe next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. \n\nHis family came back home and they have been doing really well.

They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine. \n\nI lost my love that day. The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered.
