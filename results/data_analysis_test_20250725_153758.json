        "story": "June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. \n\nWe were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. \n\n4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. \n\nMy friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. \n\nThe celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",

        "story": "Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. \n\nIn July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. \n\nIn March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. \n\nIn the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",

        "story": "About 2 months ago, one of our employees had a breakdown due to his family leaving. His family left him due to personal issues that they've been having. I was called because his neighbors thought that he had suicidal ideation due to his wife and kids leaving, and was advised that he had weapons in his house. \n\nAt this time, I was very scared and it took me a moment before I realized what I needed to do. This man needs help immediately and that he can't be alone. So, I called the cops and responded to his home and found out that he wasn't suicidal but was just going through a lot. \n\nI asked him if he needs someone to be with him or if he wants to stay the night over in my place. He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. \n\nThe next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. \n\nHis family came back home and they have been doing really well. He continues to attend Alcohol Anonymous meetings and continues to build his network of friends that he can rely on.",

He cheated on me with another women, he stole our bill money for drugs, and became a stranger in my soulmate's body. I realized that I had to get out of the situation, he wasn't going to stop on his own. I began working online so I could keep an eye on the house. \n\nOne afternoon, my husband had been gone all day, I presumed he was stealing to support his habit. All of a sudden, I saw the car he left in race past the house with police cars in pursuit. A short time later, he tore into the driveway, with the car engine on fire, and ran in the house and into the back bedroom. \n\nWhen the police knocked on the door, I was too scared to open it. A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out. There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street. I was in shock and did not know how to deal. They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine. \n\nI lost my love that day. The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered. It's been three months, he's been in jail since the end of June. I still don't know what will happen to my marriage. I don't know if anyone can come back from that. I have hope that the man I married is still in there somewhere.",

I didn't have to worry about tipping or ordering something off the menu. I also enjoyed the open bars. I had alot of different cocktails that I didn't know about before. \n\nI got to fill my satisfaction in that area. I also enjoyed the pool area where the entertainment possibilities were endless. Later at night we went to the night entertainment. There were several dance routines and comedy routines. There was a cocktail bar there as well so that I could enjoy my drinks in different areas. \n\nI didn't get to go to the night party but my wife did.

I love my coworkers. My hours are great. The commute is easy. Salary is generous. I enjoy what I do, although the changes in society post covid have really taken a toll.

Their youngest requires several in home therapy sessions each week and that requires a family member to be there because it's in the home and not at a daycare.Because of my relationship with the family, I qualify as being his aunt and can be the point person for therapy. They were willing to pay my current salary plus gas expenses. \n\nToday I let my supervisor know that October 12 would be my last day. I thought I'd be there until I was ready to retire. I'm still in a little state of shock that I bit the bullet and said yes. I'm excited and honored by my friend's trust that I can keep their precious little dude safe and be reactive to any health emergencies that might come his way. \n\nI'm hoping it works out for everyone.

Only thing is that I thought that I was missing out on those popcorn bags. \n\nWell, yesterday I was shopping for groceries with my mum and we went to check the house appliances section. With no intention to buy anything, purely just to check it out. And when I saw microwaves it hit me for the first time that we never had this very common thing in our house. Don't know why but I bought it. \n\nToday after work I will be getting some of those popcorn bags for the microwave to try it out. I know it's stupid but it's very new to me. I know you can use it to reheat food of course, but we already used a regular oven for that. \n\nAnd this microwave can't hold enough food for all of us. So now I am thinking this thing will just sit there and never get used.",
