            "story": "June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. \n\nWe were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. \n\n4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. \n\nMy friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. \n\nThe celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",

            "story": "Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. \n\nIn July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. \n\nIn March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. \n\nIn the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",

He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. \n\nThe next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. \n\nHis family came back home and they have been doing really well.

A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out. There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street. I was in shock and did not know how to deal.

Being talked down to by a stranger is now a daily thing and as much as you let it slide off your shoulders, it does grate you down each time. \n\nSeveral weeks ago, while visiting with our friends and their family, they asked me if I'd be willing to leave my job to become their nanny full time. Their youngest requires several in home therapy sessions each week and that requires a family member to be there because it's in the home and not at a daycare.Because of my relationship with the family, I qualify as being his aunt and can be the point person for therapy. They were willing to pay my current salary plus gas expenses. \n\nToday I let my supervisor know that October 12 would be my last day. I thought I'd be there until I was ready to retire. I'm still in a little state of shock that I bit the bullet and said yes. I'm excited and honored by my friend's trust that I can keep their precious little dude safe and be reactive to any health emergencies that might come his way. \n\nI'm hoping it works out for everyone.

            "story": "To the person who asked if anyone has gotten over depression in college and how to help a friend: It depends on the source of depression for how to get over it to be honest. My depression was caused by burnout so how I got over it was taking a medical leave to grow as a person outside of work/school. Like a lot of people who enter college, I felt like my whole life leading up to college was just obsessing over academics and people pleasing. \n\nMy journey consisted of a ton of therapy, a cycle of self destruction and self reflection, figuring out who I want to be for myself. Usually that's something people have time for in college, but I don't find that to be true here heh. \n\nAnyway, even though my journey was very individual- I had to do the work on my own- I couldn't have had the capacity to do it without a support system. I think as a friend, the best thing you can do is 1. Listen and 2. Meet your friend halfway. \n\nWhat I found helpful was when my friends checked in with me but didn't press or become overbearing.

Many people spoke at the funeral home, telling stories, many of which were funny because he was a very funny man, and it was a relief to remember those positive times when he would shine in his humor, which was such a gift to all of us. But there were sad points, too. \n\nWatching relatives find the courage to volunteer to speak about him and his life, then watching them break down trying to speak. They simply couldn't catch their breath. And then the next day was his actual funeral. \n\nThe church ceremony was emotional, but the priest, a relative, did his very best to comfort us with words.

I wanted it to be wonderful, yet it was hard to let him go and know that he was moving on and progressing in life to an older more mature age for a young child. I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm and I had a positive attitude overall about everything. \n\nI was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well and I am very relieved. \n\nTwo days ago we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day, and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had. \n\nHe was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall.

We are both originally from the Pacific Northwest and about a decade ago we both had nothing and we flew across the country with almost nothing to our names to start our life on the east coast. She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. \n\n \n\nAbout 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. \n\n \n\nI remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. \n\n \n\nThat trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. \n\n \n\nWe made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us.

We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another. \n\nI watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her. \n\nWe continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky.

They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. \n\nLooking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, \"New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese\" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. \n\nIt turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. \n\nBut why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",

On Friday my family and I left for our camping trip to Perris Lake in Perris, California. Perris is 2 hours away from us so we actually went and stayed with a friend on Friday that lived one hour away from the lake. \n\nOn Saturday was the start of our camping trip. It was hot, 105 plus degree temperatures everyday, trust me I will never forget that. Good thing the lake was not too far from the campsite. We went with 5 of our friends. The best thing was my child got to to see one of her friends that she had not seen over a year because they moved four hours away. I had a great time. The lake was nice and refreshing. We had a couple of canoes with us so we went out exploring the lake. We had great food from the grill and fresh fruits to keep us fresh because of the heat. \n\nThe last night, on Sunday there was a storm off in the distance. We had a great lighting storm and a little wind. Luckily, it did not rain. I know now not to go camping here in the late summer because the heat was too much for me, I had mixed feeling from this camping trip because I was happy to be around some great friends I had not seen in while but the heat was awful.",

I told my husband and we both just cried and cried. \n\nI couldn't believe what was happening and was too young to lose my mom. I remember collapsing while trying to pack to fly to where she and my dad lived. I had a young daughter at the time and my heart was breaking for her that she would never get to know my mom. And that my mom wouldn't be able to get to know her. \n\nI mourned at the lost time and the major events my mom would not be a part of. It was heartbreaking. The rest of the day was a big blur, as I just went through the motions and didn't even really remember much. When we got to my parents house, we were surrounded by family and friends, but I felt so lonely. \n\nI remember just going into her room, and crying thinking how could this be happening. It was the worst day, and even 2 years later, it still is hard to breathe when I think about it. She died from pneumonia. Something that happens all the time to people, but it took my mom.

The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces.\n\nAnd then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me.\n\nThere was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone.\n\nMy bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.\n\nThe next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that.

I had just started a new job, so I had to sell a majority of my belongings and dip into my savings to pay for representation. In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actual apartment to start over in. \n\nI wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could no longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. \n\nNeedless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable. Here I was comfortable in my career path only to have an unforeseeable event turn entire life upside down. I've always been a humble person, but when you go from eating at five-star restaurants daily, to eating free Dunkin' Donuts for a month straight it really makes you realize what's really important in life. \n\nAll and all this experience has taught me a lot. Not to be jaded, but to really cherish and be thankful for the little things that you do have (like your health) instead of taking things like a hot shower or clean water for granted. \n\nI honestly don't know where this journey will take me next, but I'm honestly thankful that I at least have a roof over my head while I fight to get my life back to what it was. \"Just because you've found yourself in the gutter, that doesn't mean you have to stay there.\" I once remember my grandfather saying those words to me when I was a child...

            "story": "The most recent and striking memory I have was when I was in the hospital to receive cycle 2 of chemotherapy for my recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. \n\nThe first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs! \n\nOnce my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. \n\nUnder this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. \n\nThis was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods. We are currently trying MAB treatments to see if we can kill it that way and move onto stem cell transplant. \n\nI pray this works. I am 37 and have a wife and daughter that depend on me. I want to be here for them.",

She told me that she's sorry i felt that way, but I needed to get over myself. This of course, hurt me very much. \n\nWe had been friends for years before we even considered dating, and the relationship was starting to fade. I could not bring myself to end it at the time, so we continued. The situation worsened as time went on. We went from remarks, to full on hating each other. She would come over and i would tell her that i did not want to see her. I started having anxiety attacks thinking about what the relationship was coming to. \n\nWhen my birthday came around, I sat her down and told her that I was seriously not happy with the relationship, and it needed to end.

Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point. All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly. \n\nWe then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks. It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason. \n\nI didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home.

We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children. \n\nAfter having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn. My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out. Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred. No problem, we thought, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation. \n\nWell, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in. My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately. They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home. \n\nWhat I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren. He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish. I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears. It was very painful to witness that. \n\nFortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could. In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering and getting stronger every day. \n\nThe whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given.

Followed by frozen shared-shock. \n\nIt all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. \n\nBut when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. \n\nIt would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. \n\nWell one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. \n\nShe was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. \n\nIt's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken.

At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, \"I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?\" which only made me more mad. \n\nAlthough I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. \n\nLater on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech.

This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. \n\nWhat ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. \n\nIn the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.'

I tried ignoring it for a while, however it eventually lead to all the emotions coming back all at once. This caused me to hyper ventilate and have a panic attack. I have only had 1 or 2 panic attacks previously in my entire life, so this was very out of the ordinary. \n\nI was in my living room when this happened and my wife immediately started helping. She asked me to name 5 objects around the room, then 5 colors. This helped me focus and get myself back under control. \n\nThis was a triggering event to make me realize I needed to stop ignoring my mental health issues and seek help. So with the encouragement of my wife, I went to see my family Doctor. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. \n\nMy family doctor recommended medication, which was also a trigger for me, as I had a lot of misconceptions about taking medication for mental health. I felt like it would make me weak. I did eventually try the medication and it helped me immensely. All my physiological reactions went away. \n\nI also decided that day to seek out therapy.",

At one point he called me his best friend when we were in a group and I almost wanted to get teary because I had not heard him say something like that in a handful of years. It was really meaningful for me as an individual and I also think for us as a couple of friends as stupid as it sounds. \n\nOne night we stayed up until about four am just sitting outside looking at the stars and telling dumb stories of things we used to do when we were younger. While we can never go back to that time exactly, it was really great feeling good again and knowing that we were friends without having to feel uncomfortable like we sometimes used to. We played ping pong and jammed on instruments, to be honest we also had some drinks while we were doing all of this! \n\nIf we would have had more time we probably would have watched a movie but the guy had a wedding the next day! And then the day of the wedding it was just so great to see him happy and married. It was like everything bad that happened before didn't matter and we could go back to being best friends.

We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good. \n\nHowever, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the phillipines. One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him. \n\nThere was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal. \n\nPrevious to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy. \n\nYet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever.

I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. \n\nI was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. \n\nThe new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either.
