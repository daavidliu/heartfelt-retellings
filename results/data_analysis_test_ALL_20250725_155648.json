        "story": "June of this year my friends and I decided to road trip from Munich Germany to Croatia. My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive too late at night because we would have been tired. \n\nWe were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. \n\nMy friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. \n\n4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. \n\nMy friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. \n\nThe celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends. My friends and I were shocked and it was considered the best weekend ever.",

        "story": "Last March I went to a tax accountant. I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. \n\nIn July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. \n\nIn March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. \n\nIn the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",

        "story": "About 2 months ago, one of our employees had a breakdown due to his family leaving. His family left him due to personal issues that they've been having. I was called because his neighbors thought that he had suicidal ideation due to his wife and kids leaving, and was advised that he had weapons in his house. \n\nAt this time, I was very scared and it took me a moment before I realized what I needed to do. This man needs help immediately and that he can't be alone. So, I called the cops and responded to his home and found out that he wasn't suicidal but was just going through a lot. \n\nI asked him if he needs someone to be with him or if he wants to stay the night over in my place. He replied saying he just wants to be alone and that everyone deals with problems differently. He rest assured that he isn't going to hurt himself and that he is just looking forward to tomorrow. I took possession of his weapons to err on the side of caution and he didn't have any issue with it. \n\nThe next day, he came and spoke to me and said that he has alcohol substance abuse, hence why his family left him. He self referred himself to the clinic. He then had to go into a rehab facility for 4 weeks. He finished the program 1 week early as he did great and actually came up with his own goals. \n\nHis family came back home and they have been doing really well. He continues to attend Alcohol Anonymous meetings and continues to build his network of friends that he can rely on.",

He cheated on me with another women, he stole our bill money for drugs, and became a stranger in my soulmate's body. I realized that I had to get out of the situation, he wasn't going to stop on his own. I began working online so I could keep an eye on the house. \n\nOne afternoon, my husband had been gone all day, I presumed he was stealing to support his habit. All of a sudden, I saw the car he left in race past the house with police cars in pursuit. A short time later, he tore into the driveway, with the car engine on fire, and ran in the house and into the back bedroom. \n\nWhen the police knocked on the door, I was too scared to open it. A few minutes later, they broke the window and I told them I was unarmed and coming out. There were at least 15 police cars surrounding our street. I was in shock and did not know how to deal. They didn't ask me anything, they knew about the drugs and knew they weren't mine. \n\nI lost my love that day. The innocence of my perceived true love had forever been shattered. It's been three months, he's been in jail since the end of June. I still don't know what will happen to my marriage. I don't know if anyone can come back from that. I have hope that the man I married is still in there somewhere.",

I had alot of different cocktails that I didn't know about before. \n\nI got to fill my satisfaction in that area. I also enjoyed the pool area where the entertainment possibilities were endless. Later at night we went to the night entertainment. There were several dance routines and comedy routines.

Their youngest requires several in home therapy sessions each week and that requires a family member to be there because it's in the home and not at a daycare.Because of my relationship with the family, I qualify as being his aunt and can be the point person for therapy. They were willing to pay my current salary plus gas expenses. \n\nToday I let my supervisor know that October 12 would be my last day. I thought I'd be there until I was ready to retire. I'm still in a little state of shock that I bit the bullet and said yes. I'm excited and honored by my friend's trust that I can keep their precious little dude safe and be reactive to any health emergencies that might come his way. \n\nI'm hoping it works out for everyone.

The path was going toward academic chemistry. I was good at chemistry, I was good at research and all that stuff. But I realized that I always liked working with young people. So I actually, in 1994, went and worked at Detroit Country Day School, which is a private school. \n\nAnd started my job there and loved it, and raised my children. They went through the school, they went to U of M. And after that I started sort of feeling like not as connected to my school as it used to be, because my kids were gone. So I started to look for new things and that was the beginning of Alchemy. \n\nAnd if my learning tools can be shown to help students from everywhere get better. And there's like 50% of people that fail organic chemistry. If I could cut that down to 40 %, I think that would be success. But, this is not an easy path, it's really hard. But if you're solving a problem that you know needs to be solved, then the hurdles don't feel quite so high.",

Our students grow up in homes where they don't necessarily get a chance to learn proper anger management techniques. And so you see a lot of students who get in fights. Or they throw something so that they can get suspended. Or they do something so that they don't have to be there. \n\nThere's usually something behind that, whether it's they don't feel they are able to succeed. Whether it's they're afraid of what might happen if they do succeed. Whether it's afraid that they are just unable to grasp a concept, so it's kind of sad , but there's always a bright light. \n\nCity here is there to find those bright lights and make them brighter. We work with kids in attendance, behavior, and course performance, in English and math. And our numbers show it, where at the beginning of the year there's so many suspensions, so many fights , and then by the end of the year those are all decreased. \n\nWe had these little catchphrases that people throw around, and one of them is, this is hard, be strong. Find something that they do know how to do. Find something that they do like to do, and build that relationship on that. \n\nI know that what I do right now is very important. And I'm influencing a student everyday. Every student can succeed, we just need to find the right way to make that happen.",

        "story": "To the person who asked if anyone has gotten over depression in college and how to help a friend: It depends on the source of depression for how to get over it to be honest. My depression was caused by burnout so how I got over it was taking a medical leave to grow as a person outside of work/school. Like a lot of people who enter college, I felt like my whole life leading up to college was just obsessing over academics and people pleasing. \n\nMy journey consisted of a ton of therapy, a cycle of self destruction and self reflection, figuring out who I want to be for myself. Usually that's something people have time for in college, but I don't find that to be true here heh. \n\nAnyway, even though my journey was very individual- I had to do the work on my own- I couldn't have had the capacity to do it without a support system. I think as a friend, the best thing you can do is 1. Listen and 2. Meet your friend halfway. \n\nWhat I found helpful was when my friends checked in with me but didn't press or become overbearing. They engaged and sympathized when I had things to rant about but didn't force it. They offered me their floor or shared food when they could but also kept their boundaries and limits. \n\nWhat made things worse from some people was asking me how I was doing every time they saw me and being awkward around me...like just because depressed doesn't mean I'm depressed 110% of the time, so don't act like I'm incapable of other emotions. Also obviously ditching would be bad, but no one did that to me thankfully. \n\nBut yeah, it's not your responsibility to save your friend from depression, it's really only something they can do themselves. It's more like when someone is sick with a virus and only their immune system can fight it, but you can buy them medicine, walk with them to the doctor, and feed them snacks while you watch Netflix together yunno?",

But there were sad points, too. \n\nWatching relatives find the courage to volunteer to speak about him and his life, then watching them break down trying to speak. They simply couldn't catch their breath. And then the next day was his actual funeral. \n\nThe church ceremony was emotional, but the priest, a relative, did his very best to comfort us with words.

He is in the foster care system and we are hoping that when he gets out of the treatment center he will have learned new behaviours that will make it easier for him to have a successful adoption experience in our home. \n\nThe trip to the facility was distant. It was busy with traffic and it seemed like a rather scary undertaking. We had to rent a car and drive in a strange area. \n\nWe arrived at the destination. We then went into the building and it seemed more like a prison than a place a child would be living. They immediately had to take any cell phones. They then proceeded to check us for weapons. Then they would unlock each door we entered. \n\nIt was definitely a maximum security type of place. It seemed unusual to us that a child under 13 would need to be in a maximum security type environment for simply having Autism. \n\nThe facility we visited has kids of all kinds separated into units, some are court ordered, some are private pay and some are insurance paid. I think most parents would be alarmed if their autistic child was put in a place like that. It had no real atmosphere of a real home. I would rate it as terrible.",

We did not think anything of it as she had been having these pains for the last three weeks. \n\nBut around 1:00 am the next day her water broke while we were sleeping. We called my in-laws to watch our kids and took her straight to the hospital. She was quickly admitted and taken to a room to deliver our son. \n\nWe expected a quick labor as it was her fourth child, however it took nearly nineteen hours before he was born. The issue it turns out was he had his umbilical cord wrapped around his body, making it difficult for him to come out. \n\nLuckily, he was born healthy and without any complications. We spent the next two days in the hospital. Nurses and doctors came in and out to check on him and run tests throughout our stay. \n\nIt was a surreal experience and even though I already had been through it three times it was a whirlwind of emotion. It was one of the best days of my life being able to witness the birth on my child. It is something I will never forget for the rest of my life.",

We got up at 5 am and went to the airport anyway and found out that several flights for our airline had been canceled due to hail damage to the plane. The line to re-book at the airline counter was extremely long and workers suggested we re-book on our own. \n\nWhen I went online to check out alternate flights home, I saw that we could not fly out on the same airline till two days later. My mother and I do not have the greatest relationship so I was very eager to get home and away from her. I found the prospect of two more days with her very frustrating. I also needed to be back in town for work. I was extremely frustrated and anxious trying to decide what to do. \n\nMy mother does not know how to book flights or use travel sites so I re-booked us on a much more expensive flight from another airline. I felt extremely stressed about the cost but I knew I needed to get back ASAP. The flight I booked ended up being $515 a person, compared to the original $100 a person. I put all of the tickets on my credit card because I know my mom has bad credit and also would have to carry over a balance for a few months to pay it off. \n\nI really hated having all of that on my card and feared I would never be reimbursed. The flight I booked also required us to wait in the airport for 7 hours. I have a pretty intense fear of flying, so the anticipation was also distressing. Overall it was a very distressing experience and it made me not want to travel for a while.",

It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. \n\nThe leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. \n\nAfterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. \n\nAfter this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. \"For where your treasure is there your heart will be also\". \n\nMy sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction. \n\nTo be able to stand up in front of a room filled with my peers and honestly say that I have been clean and sober for two years was such a memorable and special experience and event.",

However, it was only kindergarten so he still felt like a \"baby\" to me. \n\nThis year however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a \"big kid\" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). \n\nMost surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, he didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. \n\nMy little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be \"mama's baby\".",

I knew he would be in PS3 all day long and wanted it to be something he loved and looked forward to. He is very affectionate and calm and I had a positive attitude overall about everything. \n\nI was a bit worried as he had not been fully potty trained for poop yet and that was a requirement. He also loves his blankie and I wondered if that would be an issue. So he started this week, yesterday actually. All went well and I am very relieved. \n\nTwo days ago we had a day of adaptation where parents went in with their child to get to know the feel of the classroom and what a day at school would be like. He did well yesterday and enjoyed time with new friends and came home happy. He was very hungry after a long day, and tired. So he went to bed early than normal, which is good as that was another expectation I had. \n\nHe was a bit fussy this morning, as he has to get up earlier than normal, but did well overall. He was happy when I left him in the classroom. I am so relieved and thankful that this has been a relatively easy transition and hope it stays that way.",

We are both originally from the Pacific Northwest and about a decade ago we both had nothing and we flew across the country with almost nothing to our names to start our life on the east coast. She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. \n\n \n\nAbout 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. \n\n \n\nI remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. \n\n \n\nThat trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. \n\n \n\nWe made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us. I'd say we're in the best spot we've ever been in as far as our relationship is concerned. I give a lot of that credit to that trip and my wife for being so understanding.",

That just made me feel worse. I went to tell Dad, but he said the same thing. So I decided to go and look for him myself. \n\nI looked for him in the garden, but he wasn't there, so I looked in the paddocks where Mum and I had taken him for his walks. Then I went into the back yard to let the other dogs out of their kennels to look for him. I thought they might be able to help me find him, but I couldn't even find him with the other dog's help. So I gave up and put the other dogs back in their kennels, it was getting dark anyway. \n\nI had my dinner and went to bed. In the middle of the night I heard something scratching on my bedroom door. I got up and turned on the light, and what did I see? I saw Molly. I let him into my bedroom and I hugged him and I patted him. I love my dog Molly, he's the best. I felt relieved and so happy to see him again.",

My daughter that had her is only 19 and I had her young as well so I am a young grand mother. I really enjoy bonding with this little girl as it lets me almost in a way relive being a mom because I'm not even 40 yet and I have a grandchild. \n\nWell this summer I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed so we had a nice family get together at my house for the holiday. During this day we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her having a really great time on her first 4th of July. \n\nThen the night started to roll in upon us and where I love we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another. \n\nI watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her. \n\nWe continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process. It really was a great night and time for the baby's first 4th of July Party.",

        "story": "I've been dealing with a chronic, \"incurable\" medical condition for around 16 years, but recently, I've discovered something that might be a potential cure. They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. \n\nLooking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, \"New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese\" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. \n\nIt turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. \n\nBut why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",

The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces.\n\nAnd then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me.\n\nThere was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone.\n\nMy bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.\n\nThe next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that. My family is broke but I didn't kill someone that day.",

We ended up losing touch after they moved away to another state. I tried to keep in touch with them over social media but I just lost contact after awhile. \n\nIn any case, I happened to be out shopping at the mall and happened to stumble across someone who looked somewhat familiar to me. I went a bit closer towards their direction and got a better look. I asked, \"Bobby, is that you?\" He responded with a yes and then immediately he remembered who I was. We embraced and gave out a big laugh. It was so funny seeing him after all this time. \n\nWe began to talk a bit and do some catching up. I had found out about why he was back in in the area and what he had been up to for all this time. I found out that he was visiting his parents and that he was out with his family that day. I couldn't believe that we would be able to see each other in such a random way. \n\nWe decided to meet up for lunch the next day and just talk a bit more about how life had gone up to this point. We really got a kick out of seeing the changes that have taken place in each of us.",

        "story": "About six months ago I entered a custody battle after my partner admitted to cheating, then subsequently ran off with our child. I had just started a new job, so I had to sell a majority of my belongings and dip into my savings to pay for representation. In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actual apartment to start over in. \n\nI wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could no longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. \n\nNeedless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable. Here I was comfortable in my career path only to have an unforeseeable event turn entire life upside down. I've always been a humble person, but when you go from eating at five-star restaurants daily, to eating free Dunkin' Donuts for a month straight it really makes you realize what's really important in life. \n\nAll and all this experience has taught me a lot. Not to be jaded, but to really cherish and be thankful for the little things that you do have (like your health) instead of taking things like a hot shower or clean water for granted. \n\nI honestly don't know where this journey will take me next, but I'm honestly thankful that I at least have a roof over my head while I fight to get my life back to what it was. \"Just because you've found yourself in the gutter, that doesn't mean you have to stay there.\" I once remember my grandfather saying those words to me when I was a child... And they've been my motivation throughout this entire experience. Both the good and the bad.",

        "story": "The most recent and striking memory I have was when I was in the hospital to receive cycle 2 of chemotherapy for my recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. \n\nThe first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs! \n\nOnce my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. \n\nUnder this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. \n\nThis was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods. We are currently trying MAB treatments to see if we can kill it that way and move onto stem cell transplant. \n\nI pray this works. I am 37 and have a wife and daughter that depend on me. I want to be here for them.",

She would come over and i would tell her that i did not want to see her. I started having anxiety attacks thinking about what the relationship was coming to. \n\nWhen my birthday came around, I sat her down and told her that I was seriously not happy with the relationship, and it needed to end. She agreed and i have not talked to her since. This event has been very hard on me as, because this was someone i wanted to build a life with and within one night, it was all gone.",

It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. \n\nAfter she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. \n\nI felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much.

At the age of thirty five and after years of trying to get pregnant and having two miscarriages, I had given up on having a child. My husband and I were looking into adopting but the process seemed pretty hard and there were no guarantees. \n\nIn the end, I got pregnant out of no where and I was shocked to my core when I found out that I was pregnant and I was two months along. The fetus appeared healthy and I was on my way of becoming a mother. Three months ago, my daughter was born; a healthy 7 pound 3 oz. No one or nothing could have prepared me for the profound love I have for my daughter and I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be a mother to my sweet girl. I love her so much and my husband and I are so very happy. We can't wait to see what the future holds and we are secretly hoping to be blessed with another child. \n\nThe changes in our lives have been mostly positive and some negatives. The positives are having our child and being able to make life long memories with her. Our families have been great through out my pregnancy and they have been so helpful in the last couple of months. \n\nOn the other hand, the negatives are not getting enough sleep. I feel tired and excited most of the time, and there are times when I doze off every chance I get. The worry for our child is horrible at times and its a major drawback for us because in the back of our mind we feel like this beautiful experience might not last and can be easily taken away from us.",

It was a contract stating my terms of employment would be changing if I agreed. My title was being changed along with my pay rate. I was just stunned, because I felt like my hard work was often dismissed and not even recognized. \n\nAfter going through this contract, I signed my name, thanked my superior, and nearly skipped out of this conference room. My new pay rate would take effect in my next pay check.

Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm. We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin. She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around. But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. \n\nArriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard. It was just so sad, all of it. Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain. \n\nAfter the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade. Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point. All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly. \n\nWe then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks. It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason. \n\nI didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home. I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt. I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again. But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way.",

Being afraid of flying made this hard enough, but the excitement of going to another country on the other side of the world to meet the woman I loved overcame all of it. \n\nShe and I made plans to meet up at the airport when I arrived, and what we where going to do. When I got there, departed the plane, went through immigration, and got my belongings she was no where to be seen. I waited for several hours outside the airport, trying to call her phone. When she finally answered, she told me she could not come to the airport. She asked me to just get a hotel and she would see me the next day. \n\nI was left in a foreign country alone I had no idea about, holding flowers and chocolates I brought for her. Looking foolish, I then decided to just get a taxi to a nice hotel for the night to relax from the jet lag, and decide what to do from there. \n\nThe next morning, she called me. She said she could not meet me that day either, maybe the next day she could. Her family called me, randomly, and said out of respect for me going all the way there they felt it was the right thing to do to tell me my girlfriend of 5 years had another boyfriend, and was pregnant.

It had many restaurants, gambling areas, pools, beaches, water sports, shopping, exercise rooms, massage rooms and dinner entertainment! Everyday we had things to do and see. \n\nThere were many memorable things I did there, like going down a huge slide with my husband behind me at once. Getting my hair braided on the white sand with two lovely ladies with a drink in my hand having interesting conversation. It was fun to pick out beads for my hair. \n\nI think one of the most memorable was when my husband took me to the Columbia Emerald store and helped me pick out a ring I like for a memory of the trip. It is a beautiful emerald ring in gold with an oval shaped emerald in the middle and smaller ones on both sides. Everyday I wear the ring and its makes me so happy to remember all the fun times we had there. \n\nNeedless to say we want to go back. Its a great place to visit and relax.

We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children. \n\nAfter having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn. My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out. Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred. No problem, we thought, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation. \n\nWell, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in. My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately. They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home. \n\nWhat I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren. He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish. I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears. It was very painful to witness that. \n\nFortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could. In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering and getting stronger every day. \n\nThe whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given. Hopefully we have many more years of his presence to make many more memories.",

I truly saw how fragile life is, how it can drain away over time and then gently release, and that there's nothing that can be done to stop it or bring it back. \n\nKich's death is so painful to deal with and I miss him terribly, but there is one thing that makes it all ok. Nothing can hurt him again. He no longer suffers. As I walked home, I felt physically light because of this fact. I felt such extreme peace even in my grief. I'm so glad my little buddy is finally free.",

Suffice to say, I was taking a big risk. I think that it was a really difficult thing to do, but I wanted to do it because it was something I believed in. \n\nI was nervous the entire time. I took an uber to the train station in Downtown Denver and then the train to the airport. I was several hours early, but I had to wait forever because there were so many people flying that day. It took about 2 hours to get through TSA and to my terminal. I then tried everything I could to stay calm until my plane. \n\nIt was delayed by a couple of hours and we didn't end up flying until around 9PM. I landed at 11AM, and was ecstatic to see my girlfriend. We got my luggage and left. I felt like the journey was finally over and I'm glad I made the decision I did. \n\nWe drove to her house and on the way got Whataburger, which was delicious. I had never had it before.",

She was ecstatic! \n\nWe also went to SplahCountry, which both of the kids thoroughly enjoyed. My sister and her family and my parents were also on the trip with us. We had a cabin for all of us that included an indoor pool, hot tub, game room, theater room, and a pool table. I have a nephew and 2 nieces, and all of the kids (including mine) shared a room with bunk beds. The kids had a blast. \n\nMy son's favorite part was when we visited Goats on the Roof and he rode the Alpine Coaster. My daughter loved going to the Hatfield and McCoy Dinner Show. We sat in the Splash Zone and she even was called up on stage! She was very excited to be able to go up on stage. After the show we were able to purchase a copy of our show, so we will always have the memory of her being a part of it. \n\nI love being able to spend time with my family and see my children experience new things.",

        "story": "My best friend in the world hit me during a fight a couple of months ago. It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face. Followed by frozen shared-shock. \n\nIt all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. \n\nBut when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. \n\nIt would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. \n\nWell one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. \n\nShe was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. \n\nIt's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken. I just hope that one day we can get past this, because it breaks my heart that such a stupid beginning of a fight has ended in more serious sadness.",

        "story": "A good friend of mine recently died in a car accident. Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. \n\nIt made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, \"I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?\" which only made me more mad. \n\nAlthough I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. \n\nLater on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",

Not wanting to deal with this treatment so late in the night I stopped reading them. The next morning they sent a message apologizing for their behavior. I took some time to take care of myself and accepted her apology a few hours later. \n\nOur conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. \n\nWhat ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. \n\nIn the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse. Since then, I have slowly grown to lose my feelings towards her. I will likely break up with her the next time this happens. ",

        "story": "My Best Friends Wedding. This event was almost two months ago to the day when I went back to Michigan for my friends wedding and it changed the way I saw our relationship. To give some context we have had some tough times and ups/downs as friends and kind of lost the original closeness we had which was sad. There were some times where we had these big fights and our relationship had changed. \n\nWhen I went back for the wedding we spend a lot of time together and it felt like old times again. At one point he called me his best friend when we were in a group and I almost wanted to get teary because I had not heard him say something like that in a handful of years. It was really meaningful for me as an individual and I also think for us as a couple of friends as stupid as it sounds. \n\nOne night we stayed up until about four am just sitting outside looking at the stars and telling dumb stories of things we used to do when we were younger. While we can never go back to that time exactly, it was really great feeling good again and knowing that we were friends without having to feel uncomfortable like we sometimes used to. We played ping pong and jammed on instruments, to be honest we also had some drinks while we were doing all of this! \n\nIf we would have had more time we probably would have watched a movie but the guy had a wedding the next day! And then the day of the wedding it was just so great to see him happy and married. It was like everything bad that happened before didn't matter and we could go back to being best friends. Nothing else mattered, all of the fights and stupid things we got mad about. \n\nI will never forget my best friends wedding, I am glad I made it back. We would do anything for each other and it was a great reminder of that very fact.",

        "story": "My mother passed away at the end of March and my sister and I made the funeral arrangements for her. The entire process was sad and painful but at least we had each other to get through it. It was stressful at the funeral home because the funeral director was constantly trying to upsell us. The money wasn't the issue. We simply wanted to follow our mother's wishes for a simple gravesite service with her priest present. The funeral director, however, kept pressing us to provide a large tent that was very expensive, as well as other amenities that we didn't think would be necessary but she literally browbeat us for more than an hour to agree to them. \n\nWe were both very upset when we got back to our car. We didn't have a choice of where to go as my father is buried at the same cemetery and of course we wanted them to be together. It made a stressful time even more stressful. It simply wasn't necessary. \n\nOn the day of the funeral it was a lovely Spring day, my mom's favorite season. We had a gravesite service and her priest did a beautiful job. I was surprised and moved when my brother-in-law's mother, who was close friends with my mother, quoted an Irish blessing that my mom always loved. \n\nAs hard as her passing was the funeral, with all of her family present, reminded me instead of the very good aspects of her life and the times she inspired, supported, and - always - loved us. As hard as it was putting the details together in the end it was a perfect service.",

I looked in the spot where my car was parked and noticed something odd. It looked like someone was in my car. \n\nI got up to take a closer look and sure enough, two people were sitting in my car, rummaging through my belongs. Anger took over me, and without thinking, I ran downstairs to confront them. \n\n\"Hey, what the hell are you doing in my car? You know I'm a federal officer, and you just broke into my car??\" I said. One of the men replied, \"so?\" I didn't say anything else, I just turned around to walk back to my apartment so I could call the cops. \n\nAs I'm coming up the stairs, my roommate is coming downstairs. She had seen everything from the bedroom window and came down to see what was going on. I rushed passed her, heading up the stairs, as I ran past her I told her they just broke into my car and I was calling the police. \n\nWhile I'm running up the stairs, I can hear my roommate trash talking the suspects. Telling them to get a job and things like that. I live on the third floor and by the time I got to the bottom of the third floor stairs I heard my roommate yell out \"he just tried to hit me with a bat\" I hurried as fast as I could to get to my apartment. \n\nI grabbed the closest weapon I could find, a knife, and headed back downstairs to help my roommate. I ran up to the guys with the bat and one proceeded to swing at me several times. I put my arm up as he tried to swing for my head, and he broke my arm. \n\nEventually the suspects were arrested. I will never forget this day and how much fear and anger I felt, and still feel to this day. I could have lost my life that night but I'm grateful I didn't.",

        "story": "My daughter and I took a trip to California. She read online about the train going down to California. It was highly romanticized but it did look nice. We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery. It surprised me that the food was so good. \n\nHowever, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met. When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story. The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them. In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once. It was really amazing. One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies. One couple was from the phillipines. One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him. \n\nThere was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story. Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story. We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal. \n\nPrevious to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close. This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close. But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me. What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband. It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy. \n\nYet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever. When she was little we were so close. However, as she became a teenager we have a more strained relationship. But after this trip we are as close as ever.",

We didn't seem to have an issue getting pregnant at first, but we kept experiences losses at various points throughout each pregnancy. With each loss I lost myself a little more, and felt defeated, almost like I had done something wrong somewhere in my life to deserve some of the worst pain a person could ever experience. \n\nOur last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought \"this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely\", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as the pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst. My entire life went dark and I no longer cared about anything. I can truly say this was darkest moment in my life. \n\nAfter months of suffering, my husband took me on a vacation to help me renew my spirit and mood, and surprise, we ended up getting pregnant on this trip. I felt so detached during this pregnancy and considered terminating as I was so certain it was going to end badly again. \n\nIt is my pleasure to say it did not. Our daughter is now 2 months old, and while I fear that something horrible could still happen, I have never felt so much joy in my life.

It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. \n\nLuckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Though I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. \n\nI made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. \n\nI was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. \n\nThe new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own.",

Ever since I started down this path I have found myself at a loss because somehow everyone seemed to be doing a better job than I was. Everyone else in my class seemed to grasp the concepts a lot quicker than I did so ultimately I felt like I was a failure. \n\nAlthough I didn't give up, I would spend extra hours after work to try and catch up and sharpen up my skills in the areas that I was lacking. Fortunately my boss somehow noticed how hard I was working and decided off my ranking in the project I'm currently working on. \n\nDon't get me wrong I know what I'm doing in the field I just learn at a slower pace. But this just goes to show that hard work really does pay off and it feels amazing to not have given up on my dream. Now I'm even more motivated to work hard towards my goals and hopefully I will make it big one day. \n\nThe moral of the story is that no matter how, no matter how useless what you're doing seems, there's always someone watching what you do and if you work hard enough toward something you will eventually achieve that goal if you don't give up. \n\nBack when I was younger I used to give up on my goals very quickly when I got frustrated. Then I would get disappointed because I would see that my progress was getting nowhere. I'm older and I have experienced this for myself. I can honestly say that giving up is never the answer. Whether it takes a couple weeks or couple of months never give up on what you believe on.",

        "story": "A couple months ago, I went to a comedy show to see my boyfriend and 2 other friends in a comedy show. Before the show started, a group of drunk middle aged people wearing \"fun hats\" came in and asked for discounts on tickets. My friend who was producing the show foresaw them becoming a problem, and warned them that they had to remain respectful and not disrupt the show. \n\nOnce the show started, they started getting loud, heckling the comedians, have loud conversations amongst themselves, and interrupting the show over and over. My friends on stage were struggling to keep the show going and not lose the audience by being too hard on them. \n\nI was finally fed up and yelled out for them to shut up. This caused a chain reaction where other frustrated audience members started yelling at them, confrontations between other audience members and them, some of the other comedians trying to get them to leave and then finally the show runner came to ask them to leave. \n\nThe main ringleader was wearing a pirate hat and refused to go after his friends did. He would start feigning falling over into the chairs when my friend touched his arm, and getting in front of the stage and shouting so that no one could move on. Finally the show runner had enough and have him some money back so that he would leave. \n\nThe show went on, but the energy of the room had changed, and no one did particularly well after that. \n\nI was so frustrated for my friends, whose sets were ruined, and my friend the show runner who I was worried had lost money since he had to return so many ticket prices for the group of hecklers. The selfishness and audacity of the group was infuriating. \n\nLater in the night however I got 2 pieces of information. First, the show runner gave them some singles instead of the full cost of the singles and they were too drunk to notice. And second, that a drunk man in the pirate hat, was spotted getting a sobriety check by the police on the side of the road not far away from the comedy show. There is no way that he was sober enough to have passed.",

        "story": "One of the most memorable moments in my life happened 5 months ago. This was the year of my graduation from university. I could not believe that I spent the last five years of my life working towards this day. During my time in university, I met many people of different backgrounds. Because of this I learned about many different cultures and became more culturally enriched myself. What makes this significant is the path it led me on today. Thanks to the many great people I collaborated with during university, I received an opportunity to work for a great company that embraces and supports diversity. \n\nThe day of graduation is one that I still remember as if it was just yesterday. The feeling of accomplishment, but also some sadness still lingers on until this day. During my last year, I got realy close to some people which is unusual for me. Many of the people I interacted with during my schooling were what i would consider acquaintances. However, these people I met I could actually call my friends. The reason for my sadness is that I knew that once I graduated, I would most likely not keep in touch as much as we did before. \n\nIn the end, we all went to school for one reason, to get a nice paying job. We didn't really go to school to meet new people; at least that's what it felt like. Anyways, the biggest thing I take away from this day is that all good things must come to an end at some point. I was counting down the days to graduation because I knew once it was over, that there would have to be a big change in my life; something I always feared. \n\nMost people would describe their graduation day with feelings of relief, happiness, and accomplishment. For me it was a bit different, almost the opposite. While the friends I made were probably the best part about going to school, would it even matter 5 years from now? I'm glad that as of now everything seems to be going well and my work has paid off. What saddens me is that I will never get to live those moments again like if it was the day it happened.",

        "story": "Our dog injuring his eye was absolutely terrifying and stressful. I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk. I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside. As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch. He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him. He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout. He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. \n\nThe next two days were awful. He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him. Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye. When I heard that, I didn't know what to do-- how do I break that to my partner?! How did he manage to poke a hole in his cornea while by himself?! It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. \n\nHe ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye. He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work. Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. \n\nIt ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye. My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed. Pupper still goes to the friend's house every day (we call it 'doggy daycare'), and we've become much closer to those friends as a result. OH, and he got his outside privileges back :)",

        "story": "In early July I played in a golf tournament that was put on by a foundation that helps families deal with cancer. It isn't so much of a research and looking to beat the disease as it is to help families lead some kind of a normal life and allows children to do things like attend camps and parents to have such things that are taken for granted like \"date nights\". \n\nI played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school. One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer. I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family. It was a very hard time that he went though as well as the rest of the family. Truthfully I struggled with it as well as, although he had been fighting cancer for 20 years, the end came pretty quick. \n\nAt this tournament there was one hole that is called the dedication hole. On this hole every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life. Without being prompted all of us put down my friends dad's name. It was at this point that my friend and I both became very emotional. \n\nThis is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point. I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time. I saw his mother recently and she mentioned that it really meant a lot to her son and he had mentioned it a number of times to her and other family members how touched he was. \n\nIt will remain something that I will hold near and dear to my heart for a long time.",

My son, who has been a daily part of my life for the past 18 years, was going away. My wife and I would not seen him again for about nine months. \n\nWe always knew when he graduated from high school that he would likely be leaving the state for college. That expectation took on a new twist when he was accepted at a school that had a program allowing freshman students to apply to spend their entire first college year studying in Italy. He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud. \n\nHowever I was also nervous and sad. While I am excited for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away. The idea of \"losing\" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, that we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside. Sure we will text and email, and (hopefully) speak on the phone several times each week, but it is not the same. \n\nShould I feel guilty over being sad instead of happy for him?

Made the reservations to fly out tomorrow. \n\nOn my way to the airport I got a call from my daughter that she had also torn an artery and was not acting like herself. By the time I reached home my mother had been sent home to hospice care because she had a stroke during the night(nobody noticed) I stepped into a bad dream when I finally got to my childhood home. \n\nShe was in a hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen and barely alert. Alert enough to know it was me, her oldest, her favorite everyone's always told me. She even said my name and that she loved me. \n\nI swear I spent five days awake, sitting in the rocking chair next to her bed, singing in her ear, saying prayers, talking to her, telling her dad was waiting for her. She died when I was holding her, just mom and I alone in her room, my mouth pressed up against her good ear. I felt her heart stop. \n\nThe aftermath was a blur. Spoke at the memorial service. My mother is gone and it will be 3 months in a few days and I cry when I least expect to and reach for the phone to call her as I did so often, but my mother is gone.",

        "story": "Two weeks ago my partner and I joined her family for an overnight trip to an amusement park for her nephew's birthday. The park was about a four hour drive from the city so we had to wake up quite early in order to make it there at a reasonable hour. I made the unfortunate mistake of drinking far too much tequila the night before so the trip was not very comfortable for me. On top of that, I had the pleasure of being introduced to a whole group of new people that I had never met before. They were all very nice, but I was not in the mood to make introductions and may not have made the most flattering first impression. \n\nWe finally made it to the park but instead of being able to relax and unwind we went right into long lines for thrill rides and roller coasters. Frankly, I thought that I was going to lose consciousness on multiple occasions. My head was killing me and I was having to depend upon my partner in order to remain upright. We ate an extraordinarily heavy lunch and I began to feel a little bit better. Many photos were taken that included my pallid visage and I managed to make it until we finally left for the hotel that we would be staying in that evening. \n\nUnfortunately, this was not the end of the evening. Our party still needed to go out and buy a cake and eat dinner for her nephew's birthday. When we arrived at the bakery it had already closed, but after some pleading with the remaining staff we were able to go inside and purchase a cake. We then found a nearby restaurant and the celebration was actually quite pleasant. \n\nThat night I slept as though dead even though we were sharing our hotel room with my partner's mother.",

        "story": "About 5 months ago I quit my good job up in Virginia, sold my home and moved back down to Florida. It all started out 4 years ago when my Uncle who owns a couple of event planning companies asked me to come work for him since his main company just received a huge contract from the federal government. I said yes right away and quit my job as an assistant manager at a hotel and left for Virginia to work for him. He offered to let me stay in his basement which was just a really nice downstairs apartment. I was very grateful and stayed with him for a year until I saved enough money to get in to my own place. \n\nAt first I really enjoyed the job and put in my best effort. The two owners, my Uncle and his best friend were very happy with my performance. I was given a 50% raise after only six months on the job. After a year, I was promoted and given another significant raise. \n\nAfter being promoted I was put under the supervision of a new boss. She was very good at her job but unfortunately was not good with the people working under her. She would talk very badly behind our backs and would not think twice about throwing us under the bus if it would keep her from looking bad. I worked for her for a couple of years until finally I and a few others had had enough. \n\nI complained to my Uncle and his best friend who was also my old supervisor. They did not believe that she was such a problem. My work ethic started to decline because I was very discouraged by it all. I started to not take things seriously and then began to spiral out of control to a certain extent. I was not the only one on the team with this issue. \n\nFinally I tried to quit several times but was guilted into staying on the job. Then over the course of one week I purposely did not show up for a few days until they were forced to fire me. It was a hard thing to deal with considering how my uncle who I was very close to looked out for me in several ways and because of that we became very close. \n\nThe fallout was not pleasant and because of it all the relationship between me and my uncle is now severely strained and I will never work for him again.",

She is elderly and had been diagnosed with a terminal illness, but had been coasting along for a couple of years without much deterioration. About six weeks ago, we took her to the ER with what we thought was a mild issue. It was not mild. Her illness went a sudden and steep decline. \n\nWhen I went to visit my mother this week, I heard her yelling before I entered her hospital room. She did not focus on me when I entered the room and she looked terrified. She kept repeating the same nonsense phrase over and over again. Of course, I wanted to do something to comfort her. She seemed fairly unreachable. \n\nI finally went to ask for her nurse to come so that we could see if there was a medical intervention that might comfort her. My mother's doctor came to the room and explained that she had been unsettled the previous evening, so she was given a medication. As a result of the medication, she slept last night, all day today, and had recently woke with hallucinations. \n\nI am generally a stoic person, but while the doctor was talking, I began crying. I could not seem to stop. I cried during my entire drive home. I thought that I had become desensitized to my mother's health decline, but I found at that moment that I could not handle her clearly suffering. \n\nThe hospital is steering clear of the medicine that gave her the hallucinations, so I will hopefully not see my mother looking that terrified again.",

Finally, we were able to find a free weekend for both of us and booked everything very last minute. We started off getting dinner at an Italian restaurant with her parents, which went really well! I was a little nervous going into the dinner but her parents were very nice and it was a relaxing dinner. \n\nAfter dinner we went to our hotel in the city. Saturday I did not think we had any plans, but I was surprised that my girlfriend had a whole day planned out. I was surprised and happy she spent the time to plan a whole fun day for me. We spent the day going to museums, breweries, parks, and ending the day riding a tram up a mountain for a view of the city, and ate dinner up there. It was a really fun day and the whole thing made me really happy. \n\nThe next day, we went to a Pittsburgh Steelers game. The stadium was really cool and it was an exciting game. The fans of the Steelers were so passionate and enthused it made the experience very memorable. \n\nAfter the game, we drove home - I drove while my girlfriend slept. It was a tiring weekend as we had a lot of activities, but it was great nonetheless.",

Going sober for 30 days seemed like an easy undertaking, at least at first. \n\nLet the journey begin! Day 1 was inspiring, I visualized my future self as a sober successful and highly functioning human. Big announcements were made to all of my friends and family about this new undertaking, the new sober me. \n\nDay 2 - 5, this is easy being sober and slightly more functional. Motivation to work out kicked in around Day 6, which lasted until about Day 9. \n\nDay 10 - 15, I yearned for this new and improved sleep I was promised so early on in my quest for sobriety and it finally came. The deepest soundest sleep I have had in years, it felt amazing to wake up so tired because you slept so hard - I got this! \n\nDay 16 - 20, still sleeping and I guess I am a better functioning human. Still hate my job and only slightly more motivation to work out. \n\nDay 21, an invite to join friends at a bar - gulp! Could the new sober day me complete this test successfully? Yes, I did it! I went to a bar and woke up the next day feeling great - no hangover to plague me. \n\nDay 22 - 26, sleep is great, sleep is good but what about the higher functioning me? Have all of the years of almost daily drinking dulled my ability to be a higher functioning successful person? I only have 4 more days to figure this out, maybe it all clicks on day 30? \n\nThe final 4 days were spent recapping this journey until it arrived, the big 3-0.

        "story": "Recently my oldest daughter graduated high school and is starting college. This is all new to me, and it came at me like a freight train. There was so much growing up done in the last two months, I barely recognized my little girl. I was planning parties, and attending parties, and getting finances in order, and trying to be happy all at the same time. I thought I was ready for her to be an \"adult\". I realized quickly that I wasn't. \n\nIt's hard to watch your kids grow. It makes you think back to all the people you wanted in your life to see this, that aren't with you anymore. It is the most crazy time in my life. I think back and the first day of kindergarten wasn't that long ago, was it? \n\nWe had a great grad party, all her friends were here. We had all of our family over. We ordered so much food, and the biggest cake ever. We all had such a great time. I realized then, that she was growing up, and that her friends weren't really \"kids\" anymore either. \n\nIt wasn't soon after the grad party that she was already getting her things in order to start college. I will admit that a little part of me is glad that she is going to college locally and staying at home. It's nice to keep them as long as you can. \n\nShe's been in college for two weeks now. Stress is real to her now, and to me. I think we have both done some growing up and realizations have occurred that we are moving on in life together, just in different ways. And it's harder for some of us to do it gracefully, but we do our best.",

        "story": "I took a trip for work that included a close friend. The trip was for a conference, but we chose to stay over a couple days, and she brought her daughter along for the trip as well. Overall, the trip went ok, but there were reminders of why our friendship was strained. \n\nWhile I do still care about her, and I believe she still cares about me, the trip cemented the idea that we're basically at a point of the friendship ending. While spending time together was nice, there was an air of separation , and almost a wall between us. It's easy to understand why. The fact that we attempted a romantic relationship that failed and tried to keep everything normal worked a while, but we can't keep that up forever. So we're now in a situation where we're close but divided, being friends for 15 years can't just be cut off, but its almost like it stops now, and we just get to share the past. \n\nWe got to experience Washington DC together, but I don't think it will ever be \"our\" trip, but rather a trip we both went on. I'll at least have the memories of the museums and memorials for myself. \n\nIn terms of things that happened, we had many periods of silence while even being in the same room, and at times it seems she didn't want to be around me. As I could, I would go do my own thing so she wasn't getting upset, but it was painful to do so. Realizing you're not wanted isn't a fun experience. There was never a situation where she said I needed to go away, but it was made uncomfortable by the way she acted. \n\nIt's hopefully something that will heal with time, but I don't know that it will. It's causing me to look into new jobs so that I can remove myself from the situation.",

When he asked me to back it up a bit, as I was turning around the weight of the trailer threw the dolly towards the trailer and sent me flying. As I was falling, my head hit the trailer hard. As I fell on the ground, I instantly knew I had broke my arm. My Mom called 9-1-1 while the pain I felt equaled child birth or kidney stones! \n\nFinally the ambulance arrived. On the ride in, every bump he hit caused so much pain! The ER did an incredible job. First I had an MRI to check on the extent of my head injury. Then they x-ray'd my arm. That was tough because I didn't want the technicians to touch my arm but they did an outstanding job. \n\nFinally the doctor came in and said I had sustained a catastrophic injury. Both my ulna and radial bones in my right arm had snapped in half! I couldn't believe it. I had absolutely no support in my arm. He said Slocum Orthopedic would be calling me the next day as I would need surgery. He also put two staples in my head and home I went. \n\nNeedless to say, I didn't sleep that well. At 7:30am the next morning, I received a call from Slocum. They wanted me in to see the doctor at 10:05am. My friend came and drove me into the appointment. I found myself laying in the operating room having surgery at 2:15pm that day. \n\nNow began the process of rehab and getting full use of my dominant arm back.",

I don't really enjoy travel due to the traffic and stress but decided that I would go to see my favorite band. I immediately purchased the tickets when I was able to get them on presale and I also purchased special parking. As the day of the concert slowly approached I became anxious about the travel. I started thinking that maybe I should just sell the tickets since it was a sold out show. In the end, I decided against it. \n\nOn the day of the concert I was the one to drive the whole way there, including to a restaurant in the heart of the city. I was pleased I'd made it that far without a large amount of stress. From the restaurant my partner drove us to the concert. We had fast pass so got inside with a shorter line. It was a pleasant day for an outdoor concert and we even had lawn chairs provided by the venue. \n\nThe concert and evening was better than expected even though my partner was cranky about their seating arrangement. It was a wonderful night in a good setting, even though the 22 year old in front of me was drunk and obnoxious the whole concert. The group I was going to see surpassed how I thought they would perform live. Even my partner who didn't really like or dislike the band commented on what a good show it was. \n\nEven now reminiscing I'm pleased I changed my mind and went. And looking back, even though we got unnecessarily lost on the way home and fought regarding that, (when I wasn't driving), the concert itself was worth it.",

On the card it said, \"I have an amazing son... who knows who he is and what he wants. Tells it like it is and lives his own truth.\" The guitar had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card. \n\nFollowing that she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this, because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though, initially the popcorn was stale a fact I bought up to her she suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. \n\nAfter we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. \n\nFollowing that she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that, because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. \n\nIt was a fun day all and all and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.",

I killed my back lifting it into the cart. I hurt my back so badly I could not get it out of the cart and into my car. I had to have someone from the store do it for me. \n\nI asked my neighbor to please move his truck sometime that week so that I could install the birdbath. He got furious, started going off about property lines and blah blah blah. I remained calmed and I showed him the property line and said nicely, didnt mean to upset you, I just want to install a birdbath on my property in front of my cat window. \n\nSo with the help of my roommates walker with a seat on it, I was able to move the heavy birdbath from car to where I was putting it in.

Usually when I'm leaving the house the house, I tell her, since she needs the key to get into the main house. My sister lives in our outhouse, and she usually comes to the main house to do some things. I think, since I'm not certain, that was the first reason that annoyed her, which ultimately led to the fight. \n\nAnother thing was that as I was leaving the house, I ate a bit of her food before I left, since I knew I had a long day ahead of me. When I got to work, my sister called me, but I didn't pick the call. Thus, this all accumulated to make my sister angry. \n\nAs I was coming home from work that day, I was also a bit agitated because I was not able to get home early due to traffic, but my sister did not go to work. When I came home she asked me a question about both the food and not telling her when I left the house which I answered in a snobbish manner. She then asked another question which I didn't respond to this time. After that, she then took offence and started to get angry, but as I was also angry things escalated quickly. \n\nCareless words were said by both parties and it nearly turned into a dire situation . Thankfully the intervention of my other elder sister stopped things. I must say things were sour between the two of us for about 2 weeks due to the fight. All is well between us now though.",

It prevents me from impulse shopping. \n\nI double checked my bank account balance just before heading out to get cat food today. It's the last necessity for the month and as expected, I had just enough so I left the house with nothing but my card and a few dollars in change. \n\nMy card was declined twice. I asked the cashier to hang onto my stuff for a few minutes so I could step outside and call my bank to sort it out. It turns out that only moments before, my bank withdrew my monthly fees. They were a week early so I wasn't impressed but I still had enough if I used the change I had. \n\nIt was a pain in the ass but not a financial crisis so I headed back in and stood in line again. A woman who was just finishing up at the cash walked to the back of the line and handed me my purchase with a smile and said she'd already taken care of it. \n\nI thought I was going to cry. I've had a really rough week dealing with PTSD flashbacks and this lady touched me hard in the feels. I let her know I got the problem sorted out and could pay for it but she declined so I said \"Well, thank you! That was very sweet. If I can't pay it back, I guess I'll just have to pay it forward.\" She made my day. \n\nNext time I'm out, I'll make someone else's day.",

There were missing money from that project and some others as well. \n\nEven though I had nothing to do with it, it was not the first time, so they said they need to let me go. I had no more option than quitting my job. I was sad and depressed for about 4 weeks. I was constantly blaming myself for what happened. Those were the worst weeks of my life. \n\nI finally understood it was not my fault and things happened for a reason. I got another job almost as good as that one.

        "story": "On July 4th, I was admitted to Kaiser Hospital in Los Angeles while suffering what turned out to be a heart attack. It had begun the previous day and the uncomfortable feeling just didn't go away. At 3:30 AM, I drove from the San Gabriel Valley to the facility, about 15 miles away. My friends still think I was nuts and my family agreed, saying that this apple did not fall far from its tree, seeing that my dad did the same thing when he had his heart attack at 65. \n\nWhile at the emergency ward, I began to get suspicious and came up with this conclusion: the more different doctors visit you in a two hour period, the more serious the condition. For the next few hours, I was prodded, tested and sent to another hospital where two stents were inserted to make the \"widow maker\" work better (it was 90% blocked). Within a few days, I was released. \n\nHowever, the world I knew for 61 years changed with those three days. Probably the greatest challenge wasn't so much the junk food that consumed this average baby boomer so much as the time I had to take to make that work. Seasoning food without salt takes creativity. Substituting fruits and whole wheat involves careful planning at a store. If i eat out, I have to check the menu more carefully to eliminate anything with too much sodium, or with processed sugar. In short, this new diet demands attentitveness, something I ignored when it came to health, but didn't when it came to work. \n\nI'm not through though. In a few weeks, I have to meet with a cardiac surgeon. Yeah, bypass. That means a few months recovery at a time where I don't think I have the strength or resources to fully get back on my feet. But I have friends and family and my own tenacity. I can prepare a salmon, I can rise up from however many bypasses they have to put in.",

Its never over until the final horn sounds so in the back of our minds we kept thinking the worst. \n\nWhen they actually did it we went crazy with all the other people at the stadium but also I could see my dad crying a little. It brought me joy to know how happy he was in this moment and i was glad i was here to share it with him. \n\nThis is something we will continue to talk about for years to come and we will always know where we were when it happened.

He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket.

Our cousin had a great game and played very well. At the end of the game, his mother and father were gonna celebrate his game victory, but instead there was a life threatening turn of events that occured. \n\nThey waited and waited and he never came to the room. So soon after they got a call from the coach and during the call they heard frantic screaming in the background-it was their son. The coach said we have called 911, your son is in severe pain. So the EMTs arrived and picked him up. At that time, he began to have seizures. \n\nOnce they arrived to the hospital, they rushed him in the back. We all thought he was not going to make it through the night. When we received the first call, we were already in route to go to check on him. The seizures continued until they had to give him some medicine to stop them. Things seemed to get better, but he stopped responding. \n\nOver the next day, he was not physically talking and continued having seizures. His body took a bad hit. All the tests were showing nothing was wrong. After a few days, the seizures stopped topping a total of 12 within a few days. He still was not talking, but he was alive! He did not talk for a week. \n\nTests finally determined that he had suffered a heat stroke. Finally, an answer to the mysterious chaos. He became a living miracle. He regained his strength in walking then started talking. He still wants to play football, but it has not been recommended by doctors.",

He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. \n\nAfter my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed.

My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home. I didn't even get to see his dorm room or campus or anything. \n\nI miss him a lot as everything just seems different now that he is gone. I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time. He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us. \n\nThe car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed. My wife drove his bike down a week later. \n\nThe entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp. He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down.

We decided to drive because it was cheaper than flying and there were three of us. On the way we could stop and see family members I haven't seen in a few years. We packed up snacks and sandwiches for the road trip and were on our way. We were so excited to see our son. He has been away for almost a year and this was the first time we got to see him. \n\nIt took us two days to get there and and the first night we stayed with family. It was so nice to see my mom and sister. We all went out to eat and tried to catch up as much as we could. We called it a night at about eight because we needed to get up at three to get moving on the last stretch. \n\nThe trip itself was fun. We all love road trips and this one we got to see places we have never seen before. We got to Houston, Texas around four in the afternoon. We checked into our hotel and headed down to the restaurant to get dinner. \n\nThe next morning we got up real early. We headed over to the base, checked in and tried to find a parking spot. It took awhile and we were almost late to the ceremony. We then walked over to the auditorium. We were seated and then watched as all the sailors came in and sat down. The ceremony was awesome and afterwards we got to spend the rest of the day with my son. It was so nice to see him again. \n\nAt the end of the day we said goodbye and headed back to our hotel. The next day it was back on the road again. It was such a nice trip even though we were short on time.",

She was not happy to go, but at the same time, she knew that she could no longer maintain her own apartment, and needed some help on basic tasks. Moving her out of her home was hard. I was sad as I saw her part with many items that she no longer had room for. I was able to hold onto some items for her, like our family photo albums, which made me feel sentimental about the times when we all lived together and my father was still alive. \n\nThe assisted living space was nice, but it felt impersonal to me, like moving into a hotel room. I worry that the staff won't take good care of her, that she will be lonely or mistreated. She says she has made some friends, but she still sounds lonely. \n\nI can't visit her as often because she doesn't like to sit in the common room and doesn't want me in her room. I take her out to dinner but feel sad when I drop her off. Seeing her so vulnerable is unusual to me. I have always thought of her as strong. Now it seems I am stronger. \n\nHaving recently dropped a son at college, I can say this was the opposite experience. In dropping him off, I saw him making his way toward manhood, whereas in moving my mom to the home, I see her becoming more childlike again. \n\nThis new way of life is difficult for me, though I expect it is more difficult for her, as she has lost her autonomy in many ways.",

The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated. It started with a very long labor for my wife who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs, and during this time she needed me more than ever. I had to be strong, physically and emotionally, to help her cope. Eventually she took the epidural and the labor became more of a waiting game. \n\nBut giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions. As a result, she had to have a C section, a devastating result for her and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down. \n\nOnce that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered. She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond to us. I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being. \n\nHaving family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation. It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for. The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind. \n\nThe following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything. Having the nurses there for support and questions was something we never wanted to give up.",

She had wanted to go for over a year because she enjoys the experience of being able to ride roller coasters all day. She enjoys the rush of the speed you feel, the excitement of the loops and the thrill of dropping at high speeds. \n\nSo this year, on her birthday, we were finally able to take her. She said it was the best time she's ever had, because she got to go to her favorite amusement park and got to experience it with her family and friends on the same day. We rode many rides from sunup until sunset enjoying fun rides, crazy rides, and scary rides. \n\nAt first she was a little timid because it has been almost two years since she last went on a roller coaster, but we made it work and she overcame the fear and persevered to be able to enjoy her day. One ride in particular that she says was definitely her most memorable time because of the sheer terror it puts into you, the height it goes to, and the countless amount of loops was on Superman The Ride. I liked this one also as it suspends you in a flying position throughout the ride. \n\nWe enjoyed awesome snacks throughout the day and really bonded over this experience. She got to hang out with her two best friends and it was good for them to bond because with social activities and school it seems as if they never get the time to hang out and socialize with each other anymore. \n\nWe went on a couple of water rides also, which they both liked and hated because it cooled us off but also because they had to walk around in wet clothing. We also rode the Batman just before dark and it was really enjoyable riding it as the sun was going down. \n\nAll in all a great experience and a very Happy Birthday for my daughter.",

I thought it as a duck at first, so I didn't pay much attention, except that maybe I would move it after unloading my groceries so that it didn't get run over by someone else parking at the store. \n\nI put all my stuff in the back of my trunk and got in my car. All of sudden, I remembered about the baby duck, turned the car off, and got out to go move it to a spot farther away in the parking lot, closer to the canal on the west side of the grocery store. \n\nI was shocked it see it was not a duck, but rather, a baby kitten covered in ants! I grabbed a Gatorade bottle that I had just bought and in a panic dumped it on top of the kitten to wash off some of the ants. The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. \n\nA person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. \n\nI decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap and bring it home. I have bottle feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. \n\nI was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going to have a chance at survival. I stayed up all night feeding him goat's milk from a syringe every two hours. I kept him warm by placing a sock filled with uncooked rice that I heated in the microwave every 30 minutes or so. \n\nIt was a long night, but he survived! I was so happy!",

The weather was beautiful and I was on cloud nine as I drove down the interstate to celebrate with my wife and kids before soccer practice. I decided to take an express lane to get home faster and was exiting back on to the normal roadway when everything seemed fine. I checked my mirrors and looked back to my right, as I was merging from the left, and saw plenty of space to merge. \n\nAs I was almost completely merged a felt a soft (extremely soft) bump and then a second or so passed and I heard the blast of my horn. It was such slight impact that it took me a moment to realize that I actually was just in an accident. I looked back in mirror and waved to the driver that I was going to get over to the right hand shoulder and pull over. \n\nAs I eventually pulled over the driver of the car got out and started yelling and then the passenger of the car got out and was even more mad. I got out to assess my car and theirs and I see that they are already calling the police. I thought to myself that this was no big deal as my car barely had a scratch on it and theirs only had minor damage. \n\nAs we waited for the police I began to process things and realized that I am probably going to be ticketed even though they were the ones that initiated contact with me and hit me in the back, but because I was the one merging I was going to be at fault. I thought more and more about it and I reassured myself that I had plenty of room. \n\nAs things progressed, I was ticketed and I talked to the other driver and she talked about how she worked at a body shop and could fix the car at little cost. She said that they were alright and were okay and then they left. \n\nLater on, I found out that they were trying to get a large settlement from my insurance company and hired a lawyer and were claiming injury. It hit me at that point, that I think they were trying to pull an insurance scam. They knew that I would be at fault for merging and they could get money out of the situation. \n\nNow when I think of that day, I can only think of the accident and how I was taken advantage of and I don't really feel happy about closing on my new house.",

I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so. \n\nMy mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant. When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out. \n\nThis was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side. To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact. \n\nI am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided. This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again. \n\nI do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether. I now feel like a failure even more and I did not stand up for something that I loved dearly. I want to talk to my mom about this but our family is in such discord now that I do not want to add any fuel to the fire.",

        "story": "I went to a holiday celebration with a backdoor cookout. It was memorable in the sense that it was the first planned outing with my children, who are still toddlers. It's been difficult as a homemaker with my toddlers, especially during the first couple of years. I feel like I sacrificed a lot to personally raise them, and sometimes I still feel ambivalent about my decision to have a family. So to say this was personally memorable, at least to me, might be a bit of an understatement. \n\nThe part about the holiday party that stood out the most was just sitting in their backyard and drinking a beer straight from the bottle with the sun shining on my face. I was tasked with watching one of my toddlers while my spouse took care of the others. It felt easier with one kid. I think the work multiplies significantly with more children, and I can understand why most parents these days want to stick to one child. \n\nAnyway, that moment in the backyard felt relaxing, like something I hadn't experienced in a long time. It was equal parts freedom, and for a moment, it felt like I didn't have any kids at all. I mean, I had one that I was watching at that time, but that fleeting moment felt like a tasty raindrop when you're stranded in a barren hot desert wasteland. \n\nMy children thoroughly enjoyed the event, despite not really eating the great food. They got to play around with other children that were also there, and they got to see what an actual party with adults seems like. I personally enjoyed it, and wish for more events like that in the future.",

        "story": "Last month I was part of an amazing charity event that blew my mind and made me feel like I was making a difference. I was told about this event about 3 months ago and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community. \n\nI did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success. \n\nAt the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. \n\nIn the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given, and what you can do to make it even better for others. \n\nIf I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",

I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one. \n\nBetween getting the keys and signing the papers I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home. The home inspection went well then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly and I walked out no longer being a home owner. \n\nDefinitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all it was a great success.",

We were always pretty poor; I had a low paying job and she was unemployed, but it wasn't a problem before. The biggest issue was that we always had roommates before, but then they moved out. We could have potentially gotten replacements, but the house was so old and run down that nobody seemed very interested. The landlord wasn't very responsive and to make things worse, some squatters had been nextdoor for several months already. \n\nAt a certain point, I no longer had enough money for rent payments. It was a very stressful time in both of our lives. Through some stroke of luck, one of the members of my girlfriend's church was looking for new roommates; someone that was friendly and we could trust. Thankfully, they trusted us as well, since we still didn't have the income to pay rent, but were looking for work. \n\nWe started packing and got ready to leave that old house behind. I still hurt when I think about that old place; we had a big back yard with a beautiful garden and it was fairly peaceful until the squatters were there, but those times are lost to the past now. It took nearly a month to get everything out of there; we had made our lives there together for about 3 years and I had lived there for 6 years before; most of my adult life. Thankfully we were able to get help moving boxes. \n\nI don't know how we managed to get everything stored away here, but somehow my girlfriend found a way. She can do anything when she puts her mind to it. We've been here for 3 months now and it's starting to feel like home, but there's still things to get used to. We live with 2 other people and have to share a bathroom, which is pretty annoying, but I guess it's okay. \n\nIt almost feels like I'm going through a haze, still, but we keep on going. My girlfriend has a job now and I'm bringing in small amounts, still. Sometimes it feels like we're struggling to make ends meet, but I guess that's life.",

        "story": "It was late summer and I was still in the local baseball recreational league for adults. The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. \n\nThe team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were a subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. \n\nWe had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. \n\nOnce the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. \n\nAt the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago.",

It was a beautiful day outside so I took my time and enjoyed myself on the way there. \n\nI was nervous buying the pregnancy kits. I'm not sure why, because I'm an adult in my mid 30s, but it still made me feel like I was doing something I shouldn't be doing. I headed straight home with the pregnancy tests, where my wife was ready and waiting to take one. \n\nShe took one of the boxes from me and ran into the bathroom. About a minute later, she emerged with a smile on her face and held up the test to show me the positive result. We both smiled and hugged each other.

We spent hours there just talking and people watching. I still think about that afternoon and how much fun we had together just being together and not really doing anything at all. \n\nBesides that day, we had a couple great meals at some neat places. We also went to try a new place out that was really bad, and yet we still made the most of it. \n\nOverall, that trip was one of my most favorite times of my life.

It was even more difficult because there were loose rocks under us for much of it. \n\nEvery time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry it was so beautiful. \n\nThere was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to traverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she suprised herself. \n\nIt was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives.

He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. \n\n \n\nMy mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. \n\n \n\nWhen the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. \n\n \n\nFinally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. \n\n \n\nWell, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated and from that moment on our lives had changed forever.",

This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went though a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend and we could talk about important matters with one another. \n\nAt one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a \"Hi, how are you?\"), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours, but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days, and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again. \n\nWhen he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month, and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going, but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea. \n\nThe wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time.

Just last night I had to get our 10 month old puppy from going after 5 big raccoons. This morning she was laying on her back chewing on a piece of bone that could have easily got stuck in her throat. Obviously there are things I could do better to prevent things like that from happening. \n\nBut I feel like I could put them a room with absolutely nothing in it and they'd still find a way to hurt or put themselves in danger.

My life has kind of just been disasters after disasters. Everything seems right, peaceful, and honestly like home when I'm with them. \n\nYet the next time I'm hopefully able to see them is going to be anywhere between 6 months and year. Not being able to afford the plane tickets due to losing my job (I'm now on the perilious hunt for another one), family complications, housing situations, and anything else that'd like to pile onto the list. \n\nI suppose I'm just here to vent, I'm just missing my other heart so much lately. Their comfort is unmatched and it's cruel that they live so far away. \n\nI think my existentialism is leading me into overthinking, and I'm fearing they're drawing away from me, but both of our lives are drifting us apart. Which I guess is another factor making me so desperate to see them again, in fear that they'll leave me in time as their love may fade the longer we're apart. \n\nThey call me usually once their day is finished and I hear all about their days, usually filled with adventures I'm missing out on and I simply think \"I wish I could be there\", everything we've talked about doing together. I feel so distant some days. \n\nI love them with my entire heart, and I know they love me too, but I feel selfish asking them to wait for unguaranteed plans and dates for my next visit.

        "story": "I am really thinking about this idea that whatever happens, happens for a good reason and in the end everything will work out in my favor. Why I started thinking like this? Recently I got a random thought that the thing I like to do now which even earns me some good money, happened just because I failed my exams. \n\nI knew about this thing since September 2020 and ignored it, I gave my papers in December that year, results came in February and I failed and gave again at the end of July. Having a good amount of free time in August 2021 I decided to finally look into it and since then it has changed me forever. Now if I would have passed my exams I doubt I could have even thought of this thing because I had other things to do in February and later got busy with other exams. \n\nAfter thinking this I realized more things, because of failing that exams and delaying my progress for 6 months I found so many better people and had so many great experiences which I would have not had if I cleared it 6 months ago, like there were covid restrictions 6 months before I did this so any chance of meeting new people at that time goes to zero. And my old self couldn't have even possibly imagined it, this thing I didn't even think was possible in real life and now that it's in real life its like 100 times better. I can't be more grateful for failing that exam. \n\nPros I have realized while thinking this way: \n\n1. Excited for the future even when going through bad times. \n\n2. Always trying to figure out how this bad things turn out to be good for me. \n\n3. Less complaining and more grateful. \n\nCons I have realized: \n\n1. You get lazy, won't work too hard, like what's the reason if it will turn out in my favor. \n\n2. Day dreaming a lot. \n\n3. Family and Friends might think you have given up on life. \n\nAnyways this is what I think. Some might say that you would have got all this even if you passed, but the timing of it, everything seems so perfect I can't see myself doing any of this if I passed.",

If my stepdad had a bbq and one of my friends rolled up smelling hot dogs he'd give them some food. I remember my mom splitting two cans of speghettios and buttered bread among five random preteens who found each other while biking around the neighborhood, and those five random preteens giving mom some of their help because we knew she was full of it when she said she \"wasn't hungry\" or going to my best friend's house with three bags of ramen because another friend had a can of peas and another had tuna and we all shared our 'casserole' among like five families. \n\nMy stepdad liked to bbq, nothing fancy. hot dogs, hamburgers, If it was a special occasion he'd do ribs and chicken. Mom would make a big thing of potato salad (because we couldn't afford the deli kind and hers was better) and people around the neighborhood would filter in with whatever to share and make a plate. \n\nKids would run around the neighborhood catching lightening bugs and 'causing trouble' while the \"cool teenagers\" smoke, drank and made sure the younger kids didn't die. I was always right between the \"younger kids\" and the \"older kids\" so I could go play \"big sister\" then come hang out and be \"little sister\" for a bit. (There weren't very many kids my actual age unless my cousins were over) \n\nI just love remembering those days. On one hand I never had anything to myself and sometimes it really sucked. My family was \"the safehouse\" where a lot of other families stayed at so it was rare I had my room, tv or toys to myself. But on the other hand it was awesome and I just love closing my eyes and 'taking myself back' for a little while.",

I have a new house with a decent amount of property, car, etc. I'm married to my highschool sweetheart; we started dating when I was 15, broke up at 17, then got back together again in college. \n\nI don't really do anything besides work, exercise, and hangout with my wife/dogs at home pretty much everyday. No other hobbies outside that although my exercise does include 3 different activities currently. I played sports in school, but I most definitely did not use my full potential. I had a football and academic scholarship and all that to play safety at a very prestigious school in my region; but of course I smoked weed in HS and that pretty much explains how motivated I was to exceed at that time (not that weed is bad, I still smoke). \n\nWith all that being said, 90% of the time I am extremely happy with my life and blessed to have the opportunities I do. Now the other 10%..... So basically pretty much everyday (at some point) I think HARD, and I mean very hard, about being back in highschool. Now obviously most of you would jump straight to the fact that I didn't get to play out my sports dreams; yes that's most definitely #1 on the list, but I know that. \n\nWhat I don't know is the other stuff I think about. My friends, the girls, my parents, actually being in school. I dream constantly of all those things. It's like I'm going right back to highschool with the same people and I'm making the same decisions all over again. It doesn't make any sense. \n\nI do love my wife very much but when I have these dreams it's almost as if the world is telling me I made all the wrong choices? The emotional feeling is so strong and it lasts for days sometimes after having a very vivid dream. I feel like my past self is trying to tell me it's not happy with my life now, even though I definitely am in most respects. \n\nI've talked to my wife fairly openly about it without trying to sound like I hate my current life, because I really don't. I just wish there was a way I could talk to my younger self and see what he wants!!!",

Also, like I said please bring up questions when we haven't moved to the next step first. \n\nYou: Great I know what to do now. \n\nHim: Also, like I said I hope you're keeping notes on all of this. Since, like I said it's nice if we don't have repeated questions in these meetings. \n\nPersonally, I think it's rude because about half of the time he would explain something complex one time or maybe even not at all.

        "story": "Had an intense, wonderful two and half month relationship end when he realized he wasn't in a place for a serious relationship. He said he was ready when we first met. It hurts like hell. We hit it off so well and had a lot in common and were often on the same page without even having to say it. He treated me better than anyone else I've ever been with. \n\nI'd been alone and career focused for the last 10 years and had been in an emotionally abusive situationship earlier this year. He looked me in the eyes and told me how good he felt about me and us and how good I made him feel and how he wasn't going anywhere. He said we'd get through this bump in the road. \n\nA month or so in, when he knew that I was looking for a pet, the vet clinic he works at got a kitten in off the streets. He named it after me and gave her to me saying she is the physical representation of the piece of his heart he's giving to me. Of course now I have to think about that whenever I see her.I feel bad but I may just temporarily rehouse her. \n\nI did everything I could to support him while he worked 80+ hours a week. Not everything was perfect and I maybe should have read the writing on the wall. He tended to speak impulsively and had a bit of an ego that he seemed to be proud of. He valued work more than anything and had issues with authority. I attributed it to just him being a guy. Ambition is great but obviously you have to make sacrifices to make that happen. \n\nHe spoke a little too graphically about his exes. I'm so tired of being alone. And how can someone look into your eyes and say all these things and then say they don't want a relationship? I'm 36 years old and tired of not having a shoulder to lean on. I just want to hold hands and cuddle. \n\nI brought down so many of my walls for him. I was more vulnerable with him than anyone else. He left the door cracked since his situation could change in a few months. But given how he spoke to me before and what has happened how can I trust him? \n\nHe said he really wanted me to be his friend. I told him I always was. But I get the feeling that he wants the emotional support without having to worry about reciprocation. \n\nI'm lost and alone and want it to end.",

It's been fantastic to work at this amazing place that feels like somewhere I can grow. Everything seems amazing and I'm getting great feedback. I have a job I can have a life around again, and my social life blossoms. \n\nToday, I got dumped after a couple of months of dating this girl. Her reasoning being that she doesn't want to hurt me and her mental health is preventing her from growing and wants to work on herself. Understandable and fair, I get it and have been in her shoes. \n\nI get called into a meeting with my manager. She tells me that my colleagues don't like my attitude and state I'm difficult to work with. I've really pushed myself at this new job, and tried to grow. Giving 110% wherever I can and picking up extra shifts just to get as much experience as possible. I try to be friendly with all my colleagues, and when things get busy (i work in hospitality) I'm all action, and try to delegate and stay on it as best I can. \n\nIn my meeting my manager told me, my coworkers feel like I overstep the mark and act like the boss (even when fellow supervisors say they want me to take the reins and for me to lead). I'm told I'm scary to some staff, even when I'm always trying to be friendly and helpful to others. All around I'm told that I'm not getting a promotion because my work attitude is wrong. I apparently treat staff like cattle, and I'm near enough told I should quit. \n\nThis all happened over a 3 day period where I was pulling an 11 hour closing shift, into an early morning opening shift. And all I can think of is covering more shifts to try and improve my performance and prove myself more. Stack this with me having car trouble andI feel like my life is spiralling out of control out of nowhere.",

Sort of just became really good friends like it was kind of meant to be. \n\n \n\nI could talk to him about anything. The world, politics, economy, life. We could discuss stupid jokes and life responsibilities that others didn't understand. Grad school was all consuming and he quickly became the first person I'd think of when something happened. And I think I was that person for him. He was also excited in my smallest wins. I was so grateful for him, I loved him as a friend. \n\n \n\nBut, at some point, somehow he kinda flipped on me. I don't know why. He's friendly but he's not the same. He hangs out with a different crowd a lot. We can't talk about random things for hours. He takes hours to respond and sometimes doesn't respond at all the first time I text him. He doesn't send me jokes and pictures of random things. I think I am somewhere the 4/5th person he thinks of when something happens. And sometimes, I'm not even getting news directly from him. \n\n \n\nIt's upsetting and I actually kind of hate that he's still friendly. What's frustrating is if he were a girl I would've pulled him aside and asked what this is about. We've been so close for quite a while, whats going on? But I can't do that. Not without appearing needy or like I love him or something. I can't text him a bajillion times. I can't ask him why he hangs with a different crowd. I can't joke about why he's being weird without it being awkward. \n\n \n\nBut I just miss my best friend.

This one guy in particular said women having more sex in the beginning of the relationship then slowing down is \"women trapping men\". This is normal in healthy relationships. Sex slows down for multiple reasons. Hormones being one of those reasons. Women literally have a 28-32day cycle and not being on your period does not mean your cycle is over. \n\nWhat about the negative feelings that come with this? The feeling of being used or how it could hurt because you are not aroused. Basically telling women that the man they are in a relationship with is a beast that can't be turned down. \n\nDating someone and then finding out they view sex as something you owe them, not an intimate thing you guys enjoy together. Or even accidentally marrying that person and finding out is so sick. I wish I can erase my brain of this misogynistic thoughts. This literally ruins the sex, the fun, the intimacy, and any joy in it. \n\nRelationships aren't even worth it anymore when you could go through a dry for hormonal reasons or even life getting in the way and find out your partner views you as someone who OWES them sex.",

So a lot of times I would just wake up or sleep with them shouting and screaming. \n\nBesides the messed up family I have, I'd have to go to school everyday with anxiety, fear and sadness.

Out of fear of my mom and the stereotype that without a school you can't go anywhere I decided to go back one last year and finish it. \n\nI'm extremely unmotivated so my day goes 7 hours in school and the rest preparing for tomorrow's stress. The reason my mother has failed at raising me is because she has fed fear on me, my father couldn't care less about me so it's almost as if i were raised without a father. She would always tell me don't do that, don't go there, it's dangerous. Or when I was a little kid and was terrified by something like the end of the world, she and her relatives would make up stories about the world ending and everyone dying and they would laugh as I was terrified and crying. They found it funny. \n\nWhen I do open up to her most of the time we end up fighting and arguing because she cannot accept that she is wrong in any way. I had told her multiple times to find me a psychologist which she says that she'd take me there but never does, blames it on the work she has and how busy she is. Now I cannot deny the fact that my mother has given me freedom because I don't want to make her seem like a monster parent but rather an ignorant one who failed at parenting.

I broke up with my Ex a while ago and it's been miserable since. I can't take her out of my head. Even when I'm busy doing something, thoughts of her creep into my mind.

I don't find any meaning in what I do. The chances that I'll have to work for the rest of my life for 5 days a week got me really anxious. I feel suffocated. Burdened. Unhappy. To escape all this madness within my mind, I've come to live with my friends for a while. \n\nAway from home, I thought my friends being around will help me distract my mind. It did not help. I feel unwanted. I feel miserable around them and the thought that I'm probably ruining their time as well makes me more miserable. I wanted to cry yesterday, but couldn't. We were having dinner, everyone talking and laughing and I just couldn't even smile. \n\nI wish I did not have these bonds. I wish I was alone. I wish I never made friends, never fell in love. These connections bring a lot of joy but they also add these complications and anxiety which is just worse. There's nothing I want more than peace. I just don't want to have all these convoluted emotions in my head. I try to silence them but the noise just does not go away. \n\nI am tired of these thoughts, the anxiety, the heaviness it all brings. I just want to be at peace with myself.",

It's extremely hard for me to speak up because I've never had anyone care for me and my feelings. I've always bottled up how I felt and never talked about it. Every night I lay in bed thinking about where I'm gonna be and it always ends up with me dead. \n\nShe is what gives me motivation and drives me to be a better person.

I feel if I tell them I will be viewed differently and looked down upon. I hate this but there's not much I can do. \n\nWhen she found out about how I really felt I felt relief and better. I felt as if a million bricks were taken off my shoulder. When she told me my sister found out my heart dropped, I was so scared she was gonna think that I'm not some tough guy and just some softie. But it wasn't all that bad. \n\nEveryday I struggle with my looks. I hate my hair, my voice, my face, my personality. I hate me. I don't know what she sees in me. I have no friends, no social life.

Whenever I hear some one laugh I always think it's about me. I'm just a loser. \n\nI think I'm in love with Ella. I always want to be with her and see a bright future if she stays with me. I can see some little kids running around the house and us cooking dinner. I think it would be amazing to be in her future. I've never felt love but I think Ella is showing me.

But we have sort of a cold relationship. We care little for one another, and although we enjoy seeing each other and spend time together, it's not that I feel too connected to them. \n\nMy studies right now don't fill me in any way.

I never confessed because I felt like I wasn't good enough for her. We stayed friendly with each other for a year but stopped talking to each other eventually. (Mostly on my part, I couldn't bear the feelings for her so I distanced myself). After that I forgot about the way I felt and started dating others. \n\nI never really thought about it much as I'm not an emotional person. I thought I'll fall in love again sooner or later. After years, when I was in a relationship with someone else, I started meeting her again. I realized that the feelings are back. Not only that but I realized I love her more than I could ever love my girlfriend at the time (the relationship was toxic, no need to feel bad). In fact no feelings I had for other people could measure up to the love I had for her. \n\nWe weren't too friendly with each other but we'd occasionally talk. Every word she said made my feelings for her come back. The things I loved about her before didn't change, she became even more lovely now. \n\nAfter months of talking (I was single already) I confessed to her. We weren't talking much, I don't blame her but she rejected me. Even though I was expecting it, it did hurt. I wanted to confess so I'm \"free\". So I can finally get closure and leave my feelings behind. \n\nThe problem is I still can't. It's been a year and I don't think about her much but I just don't like other people. I don't even have crushes anymore. My interest in people doesn't last for longer than a few days. I've met hundreds of people since I've met her and there are people interested in me but I'm just not able to like someone again. Everyone seems so bland. \n\nAs I said I don't think about her much, it's not like I'm still too attached. I just don't have feelings for others. I'm aware she's just another girl with flaws and that there are definitely similar people. But I just can't feel the same love for other girls.",

I usually try to hang out with them and stuff and they're fun people but I don't feel like I'm having fun around any of them and I usually laugh to the things they say so it doesn't get awkward with me staring at them. \n\nI also used to have a girlfriend who I thought I was in love with but my dad went through my phone and found out and we basically had to stop talking. I thought I was scared at first because I couldn't talk to her anymore but I realized soon that it was actually fear of what my dad would think about me. I also realized later that I felt relieved to be out of the relationship. It's not that she was a bad person or anything. I think I just didn't love her. \n\nI wish I had someone who would hug me at night. I don't really have anyone and it kinda sucks. I honestly don't even care about gender. I just want to sleep while someone hugs me.",

When I was 5 my mom met my stepdad and soon enough they had another boy. Up until this point my mother had given no reason for me to dislike her. But this all took a turn for the worse when COVID came around. My mother lost her job but because of non-covid related reasons and she got off her anxiety medication because it was starting to make her lose weight. \n\nOnce when my mom was arguing with my stepdad she started bawling her eyes out and I asked why and she admitted she had depression. That's all I know about her medical conditions. \n\nIn 2020 she started being horrible to my sister even though she was the oldest sibling and did the most around the house. And a few months ago, my step dad and mom fighting became a bi weekly thing. She threatened to break up with him almost every time they got into a argument. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, we moved into a better house that could better fit 5 people and 2 dogs. It only gotten worse from there. She would get mad because the house was going to be under my stepdad's name until they got married in about 6 months and she said she would move back into her old house and never see him again. \n\nBut instead of it being a bi weekly thing, it now happens every single day. And I don't know how to deal with it. Me and my sister have to just sit in our rooms and hope our little brother isn't hearing every word they say. Even though we know for a fact he is. I hear her threatening to commit suicide, to give us away to our grandmother. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm still a minor and can't live without my parents. I can't even stand to look at my mom anymore. I hate her. And I don't think I will ever take that back.

This was someone that was older than me by 5 years and knew what he was doing. I didn't, and he tricked me into doing things I deeply regret now. \n\nI'm still struggling now with this realization because for the longest time I tried to convince myself it didn't even happen. It has made me scared of guys and their intentions. Fear spikes in my chest whenever a guy tries to befriend me. I'm terrified for my friends when they like guys because I'm scared they'll be hurt by someone. I don't ever voice that to them because I know it's irrational, but it's obvious I'm uncomfortable and that bothers them. \n\nI wish this didn't impact my life so much. I feel bad for immediately assuming every guy is dangerous, but I can't help it. I don't know what to do about it. \n\nThis also impacts my relationships with my female friends because I avoid spending time with them when they're around guys. I haven't told them why I'm like this because it feels like I'm overreacting. \n\nThere are guys I'm friends with, but they're not close to me. They're online friends that I play video games with. I don't have in-person guy friends. \n\nI don't feel like I have a right to feel this way because there are women out there who went through worse, yet they don't struggle the way I do.",

        "story": "Today I talked with a few of my friends about the face reveal of a quite popular person and showed them a picture. Almost immediately they started calling them ugly and compared them to people and characters who are usually seen as unattractive/memes. Personally, I cannot stand such behaviour, it's okay to say \"Yeah, they're not my type\" or that you think one is unattractive but do you really need to shame? \n\nI told them that and they said that they just were stating an opinion and that it's okay since the person was an asshole in the past. I told them that it doesn't matter what the person did but what they're doing and that I think it's wrong to do so. \n\nAs I too face bodyshaming quite often it definitely hurt. I brought up said experiences and they told me that this is a \"me-problem\" and has nothing to do with the discussion. We are -or were - friends for many years now, we went through so much and for all of them I acted as a therapist, but this is a me-problem? I don't know anymore. \n\nI left the groupchat afterwards because the discussion kept dragging on and I had worse things happen in my life than discussing about stuff with people who obviously don't care about what I'm even saying. Two of my other friends agreed but they never joined the discussion. \n\nAll I know is that I have facial dysmorphia so someone making fun of one's face is just making me feel worse about me, even though that can't be used as a justification as both of them got bullied and also know how it is to be said horrible things of. They engaged in cancel culture in the past (even though they'd never admit it), so I guess I was stupid for even starting this discussion but it really hurt to see people I called my friends being such assholes to a person about things they cannot control. \n\nIf you're mad about what a person said or did, that is perfectly fine, but bodyshaming someone is just a move of one who doesn't know better. I'm sorry to them if I was being harsh, I didn't sleep well that night and it definitely rubbed a nerve, but I know they're not sorry.",

Now with quarantine I had found myself just scrolling and opening and closing the app habitually. All day every day for the past two-three months. It was honestly starting to fry my brain a bit. It also was making my self esteem really low and made me feel lonely. I'd see people get all these likes and comments and showing throwbacks of hanging with their friends before quarantine. \n\nBeforehand, when I was able to live my life and was only on the app for maybe 2 hours combined throughout the day, I hardly gave it thought. But now it just nags at me and I find myself stalking my ex or my boyfriend's ex or random girls who seem popular and naturally photogenic. It made me feel low and stupid for being so caught up on it. \n\nSo I decided to just delete the app for about a month. Maybe even longer if I feel better off. It was just generally distracting me and had no sustenance in it aside from constant memes and people posting their best selves. I've been on reddit more and it's a lot more positive with more information and things to explore. \n\nSo far I'm happy to be able to cut something that kind of is my generation's mental crack. My self esteem is going back up and my mind doesn't feel so hooked on just looking for social validation and something to consume. First day I deleted it, I kept tapping my phone where the app used to be and it's insane how it wires your brain. \n\nNow I've been watching more movies, going on walks, journaling more, and even made fried chicken today. Not saying Instagram is like this heroin for the mind but it was an app that really just sucked my brain cells away because I simply allowed it and didn't have the self control.

I have also started a treatment for my chronic illness in the last 6 months that has been life changing. I have been seriously unwell for 6 years with chronic daily migraine, cluster headaches and neuralgia. I became unwell at the age of 19 and now at 26 I have found a treatment that is working amazingly and I am becoming the vibrant person I used to be. I am still in pain everyday but it's so much more manageable now and I am able to do things I thought I would never be able to do again. \n\nSince January I have gone from a completely sedentary lifestyle with a LOT of emotional eating to someone who walks 7000 steps a day and works out 3 times a week. I have been in a calorie deficit for the past month and today I found that I have lost half a stone, lost 4 inches off my waist and 2.5 off my hips! I am so happy with my progress and even happier that I am able to combat my emotional eating binges. I have so much more energy now and I am so much happier in myself too. \n\nEarlier this month I also felt far enough into my recovery to begin to look for employment again after not being able to work for 4 years. I applied to a few jobs in the health sector and found out today that I have an interview next month to be a Medical Secretary! I cannot describe how delighted I am that I even got an interview. If I were to be successful and get the job it would be life changing for me and my family. I am so nervous but also so excited for the future. \n\nIn less than a year my life has changed so much. I was in pain everyday unable to even get out of bed most days wishing that I would just die in my sleep. Now I am active, healthy, losing weight, in a loving relationship and have employment prospects! 2020 me wouldnt recognize 2021 me in a million years. I am so proud of myself.",

She went and sat down to eat her donuts. She looked homeless. \n\nSomething in me told me she was hungry and I remembered there was pizza leftover in the break room. I told my coworker that I wanted to ask her if she wanted some pizza but I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. My coworker just said ask her if she's hungry. So I went and asked her if she wanted some leftover pizza I had bought earlier for lunch. She said that she would love some pizza so I went and got her some and warmed it up in the microwave. \n\nI brought the pizza out to her and she thanked me. Then I just continued working and finishing the things I needed to before my shift ended. Around 8:00 I started cleaning the grill at my workplace. I turned around to grab a rag and the woman I gave the pizza too was standing there. \n\nShe explained to me that she hadn't eaten in a few days and thanked me again and told me that if I give her a rag that she would go clean the bathrooms for me. I wanted to just hug this woman at this point beacuse she was willing to go clean a dirty bathroom for some food. I explained to her that it was my job to do that and that the only thing she needed to do was to take care of herself and stay safe out in the world. \n\nThis took me off guard today because this woman was hungry. I gave her food and she was trying to do something in return when she didn't have to. I also told her that she needed to stay warm out there because it's getting cold. Before she left she thanked me again and told me that it was kind of me to give her food and how much she appreciated it. \n\nStrangers can make us realize how blessed we are when we can't see it ourselves.",

Also if you have a higher level then your perks make the game easier for you, so you can give your cash to another player who is struggling and tough it out with a pistol for another round or two. \n\nI have found that I appreciate this golden time so much that I genuinely feel thankful to the other players for spending their time with me and (usually) their good sportsmanship, so I decided to always make sure to say so at the end of a match.

You couldn't have wasted my experience or skill sets more, but that's all part of it. \n\nYou can not expect your first employer or the people that you're interviewing with or the community you moved to, you can't expect them to know everything about you and understand your value right off the bat. You have to go in and you've gotta show them. You've got to compete again and so I had a lot of fun figuring out how do I become a non profit leader and build a non profit? \n\nAt the same time, I've also gotta fight these guys that wanna beat me up on national TV because that helped me pay my bills as well. So trying to juggle all those while we were having kids and everything, it was a wild, crazy transition for sure.",

When I came to San Diego to start Teach for America, I'd always try to focus on developing my leadership, that was something I'd done for a long time. \n\nI thought leadership was about sustaining action in the face of adversity, which is like adaptability. You do something different. You try it again, that's sustaining action. What I didn't realize is the importance of sustaining belief. That's a completely different thing. That's almost not adaptability. That's the fact that, once you establish a belief in something you really, really think is important, you stick to it.

What we know is that what happens after school and on a weekend can be just as powerful as what is, or is not happening in the classroom. A lot of these kids go to really poor performing public schools, so we formed this organization to try to start providing some stability and some direction in the lives of young people. \n\nToo many kids over here feel abandoned by their city, and by the rest of the world, and so we're opening their eyes to a lot of what is available in their own city.

He told me he wanted to become President of Tanzania which I thought was awesome. I learned shortly thereafter that he actually couldn't afford to go to high school. You just take a lot of things for granted like I took the fact that I could go to school for granted, that I could go to college for granted. That's what made this experience of meeting John so shocking to me. \n\nFrom there I was inspired to create the School Fund, which is a nonprofit that connects people with students in the developing world that just need a bit of money to continue their education. One of the things I think is really awesome about being a young person is, we don't always see all the roadblocks other adults might see. I saw this kid John and I was like, wow this is a big problem, let's do something about it. \n\nI didn't necessarily see all the road blocks of, oh we have to register as a non profit. We just threw it out there and got going with something. It's important that everyone of all ages finds a way to give back, so spend a little time figuring out what you're passionate about and what you enjoy doing and don't be afraid to just jump start and get going with something.",

He agreed that there was nothing he could do to change his situation and how it related to me and our potential together and that it made sense to end it. \n\nAlthough I wasn't expecting anything different, it hurt a lot that I could see he hadn't actually put any effort in, other than deciding to tell me he loves me, and that he so easily let go of the possibility of having any future. He was the one who insisted we try to be together, despite the obvious challenges. \n\nI feel even more like he doesn't care about my feelings or find them valid, because I told him I was concerned we weren't on the same page since the very beginning, and he insisted we were. I cried in the bathroom at work until I could finally pull myself back together. \n\nMeanwhile, he decided that the idea that we would be friends instead should start right away and sent me several messages complaining about his job. I had to tell him that I'm sorry he's frustrated at work and I care for him, it seemed really tone deaf at the moment and that I needed a beat before I could swoop into the role of providing him with emotional labor while getting nothing in return. I didn't say it in those words, but that's how I felt and it's just a new level of pain, because did he actually ever care, or did he just like someone caring about him? \n\nI feel like this is just another example of the fact that I will never meet anyone and I will spend the rest of my life alone.

I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. \n\nWe then got ready and headed over the venue.

As we called her back in, she turned and looked at my mother then ran off into the dark. We waited and waited for them to come back and when we heard our little mini-pin cry out,I had a horrible feeling. I stepped onto the lawn and noticed Buttons lying in her favorite spot with Sparky at her side. She had laid down where she loved and quietly passed away. \n\nI picked her up and felt her limpness and I knew she was gone. It was such a horrible feeling. She was our last link to the old life we had when my father was alive. He had loved her so much and the last thing he told us was to take care of her. Buttons was with me when I went through cancer and his loss. She was with me throughout the last fourteen years and I loved her so much. \n\nI think that losing her has had a profound effect on me because in some way it was the end of an era. It was the end of the life in Idaho living on a farm. It was the end of days and days of her waiting for me. I think that the day we took her to be cremated was one of the most painful days. Even now, I still cry about it. \n\nI guess the comfort I feel is that she died on a beautiful night, in her favorite spot next to Sparky and that was a really nice way to go. I miss her so much but I have to let her go.",

There are some very nice people who work there and they all know me by sight and are always smiling and friendly. Mike, along with several other co-workers, and I went to this restaurant because I suggested it would be a great place to have lunch. As usual, everything was going great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant. \n\nTowards the end of our lunch, it started getting really busy. We were almost done eating and wanted to get our sopapillas and our check so we could get back to work. There was a busboy running around trying to keep ahead of all the customers so Mike decides to get the busboy's attention. He yells out, \"Hey, Pedro!\" to this young kid. \n\nI was absolutely mortified. I asked what the hell he was doing and he said he calls all Hisphanic guys, Pedro. He didn't see anything wrong with it. I did tell him how insensitive his remark was but he thought I was being overly-sensitive. I wanted to crawl under a rock. \n\nWhen we were leaving, I apologized to the young busboy and to everyone else I could see. When we got back to work, we continued to discuss the issue and I don't think I ever got through to him. I have never felt the same about him from that day forward. I know he felt the same about me.",

She has been in Pre-K for a year so she is used to getting up, putting on a uniform and even being around the big kids. She was very excited to start Kindergarten. \n\ni however am not ready for her to be so ready. She went to bed early at 7PM and the lights went off! I woke her up to our traditional “Wake Up Song”. I’ve been singing her this song since she was a baby, this stirs up the emotions knowing she is now a \"big kid\" Sometimes she sings along…sometimes she pulls the covers over her head. \n\nI also got up early to cook breakfast. Our daily breakfast consists of egg whites, turkey bacon and fruit. Every once in a while I will let her eat her favorite cereal but we keep it healthy! She only ate a little bit. I reckon she was nervous. \n\nSo we grabbed her sparkly book bag, lunch box that looks like a purse and her huge shopping bag of school supplies and headed to school. I am very blessed that her school is only 5 minutes from our home. We got there in no time and I walked her inside. \n\nThe teachers had the kids sectioned off in the cafeteria by grade. I went to give her a kiss before she sat down and she covered her face!!! Later she told me that other kids would make fun of her. BUT ITS THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN!!! \n\nLooks like my baby girl is already grown!!!",

        "story": "Five months ago, my life turned upside down when my mother passed away from a terminal cancer. Losing her was completely shocking and unexpected. She was young, full of life and had a heart of gold that touched everyone who ever came to know her. She was my confidant and the best grandmother to my young daughter, I could not imagine living the rest of my life without her unconditional love and support. \n\nI never liked May, especially because my birthday was in May and the day was always bitter-sweet for me. Although my mother always made it special, I felt sad because I never had any childhood friends to share it with. Now May took on an entirely different meaning, May was the month when my mother left this world forever, I would be left orphaned. \n\nI wanted to fill the last days of her life with as much love and peace as possible to repay her back for all the love and sacrifices that she did for me while I was growing up. I brought my mother home for hospice so I could be with her to the end. I prayed to God as I watched her terrible sufferings, it seemed like she could go at any moment, however, she was trying hard to stay alive until my birthday. \n\nIt was the most important day of her life and she wanted to be there for me. She lived to see the day, even though she could hardly master any strength, she even signed my birthday card with three simple and yet most powerful words: \" I love you!\". I cried as I held her in my arms. \n\nShe feel asleep shortly after giving me my card and watching me blow the candles on the cake that my husband brought into her room. She soon slipped into a coma and took her final breath the next morning while I held her hand. \n\nI cannot describe the pain of that parting, however, God's strength and my family were the only things that carried me through. At her funeral, my three-year-old daughter came up to me suddenly and said : \"Don't be sad Mommy, you have my love forever\". \n\nThese words made my heart melt and I then understood ever so clearly that life can be summarized in three simple words : \"I love you\", just as my mother said to me before her passing. Those words can never die or be erased.",

        "story": "I am pregnant, and with that has come all sorts of thrills and fears. Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. \n\nI became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though. I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. \n\nIn that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. \n\nThis was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.",

When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. \n\nWhile he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. \n\nThe bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath. \n\nI was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years. \n\nLife goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",

It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT. It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. \n\nThis event was also memorable for one other reason. My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale. He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife. She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live. \n\nUnfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert. She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm. She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late. She passed away that night. We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable. \n\nMy oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away. He said it just didn't feel right. After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go. His oldest son took her place. It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed. \n\nWe miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.",

This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come. \n\nThe accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. \n\nThe funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation. \n\nThen, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. \n\nOn the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place. I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot of money for many years. \n\nThe confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. \n\nThis was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.",

I knew that it would happen to someone, but never that it would happen to me. \n\nI couldn't bring myself to believe that I would someday need Naloxone to be revived from the point of death twice. The effects of the drugs started to happen around 7:00 pm est when I started to go into a heavy sleep. My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up and start CPR on me until the ambulance arrived. \n\nIt took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. \n\nI ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. \n\nI was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital. I had never felt so drained in my life before until this moment where i felt like i could just rest, and finally be safe.",

        "story": "Over the Memorial Day holiday in the United States, my family of 12 and I went on a family vacation. We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. \n\nThis vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. \n\nThere were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. \n\nEvery morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. \n\nThat evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. \n\nAfter everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in. Lucky for them, I took one for the team.",

        "story": "Just this past Wednesday on August the 21st I performed my Grandfathers funeral. He was 91 and an inspiration to me. I am actually his name sake and named after him. It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! \n\nJust two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for every one of them! \n\nDuring the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly an anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! \n\nThis was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy. I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.",

Our oldest daughter started asking us about having her own room. Although we loved that house, we knew it was time to get something bigger. \n\nLuckily, we sold it after being on the market for only three days. We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been. \n\nHowever, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go. \n\nAs of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade. \n\nI love our new house, but that first one will always hold a special place in my heart.",

He shoots up regularly and has damaged himself so badly that at one point doctors thought his arm might need to be amputated. His girlfriend texted me begging us to help him. At first my husband was reluctant, but I was afraid that his brother would overdose and then he would feel guilty that he hadn't helped him, so I convinced him to do it. \n\nIt was a difficult time for me and my family because it's hard watching someone you care about go through such a painful experience. It disrupted our regular routine and made life more hectic. He didn't follow the house rules we set and didn't get along well with my husband while he was here. He refused to go to rehab, so even though it was hard we felt like we didn't have much choice. \n\nHe got really sick while he was with us and got upset because we wouldn't help him get more drugs. He has a tendency to feel sorry for himself, which really gets on my nerves, and so the tension was high. It made life difficult for my kids, which really upset me. \n\nIt was not a good time for our family and I wish now that we hadn't made the choice to invite him in because it didn't really help. He left our home and started taking drugs again and is still upset with both of us. He avoids us at family gatherings, writes unkind things about us on Facebook and acts as though it's our fault that he's still on drugs. Also, his girlfriend kicked him out and he's virtually homeless now, which he also tries to partially blame on us.",

I slowed down, and I stood next to him and looked at him for a moment. \n\nFinally, I mustered up the courage to ask him what was going on.

He said that after he found out this news he felt that his life was worthless. He told me that he had not wanted to eat for days and that it was hard for him to eat anyway. \n\nDue to the fact that he had very little money and very little support it was hard for him to muster up the strength to fend for himself. I sat down next to him and spoke with him for a while about what he was going through and offered to buy him something to eat. He accepted, and told me that I was the only one who had stopped and talked to him in months. He told me that it was a very helpful and that he would try and pick himself up from here on out. \n\nI felt so grateful that I had made such a big impact on him.

I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholic about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. \n\nMy mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. \n\nI got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. \n\nIt was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.",

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. \n\nI was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. \n\nWe engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. \n\nAlthough it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",

I had just attended a lecture at the time, and I found the content extremely emotionally draining, so I wasn't in an excellent mood to begin with. The location where my tire blew out was congested with heavy rush hour traffic; my car broke down next to a sidewalk that was labeled \"no stopping any time.\" Many cars honked at me despite my obvious predicament. \n\nA woman in a giant black Mercedes halted everyone behind her to shout at me from her window; she had a thick Kardashian accent and a Starbucks cup in her hand as she called, \"The sign says NO STOPPING ANY TIME.\" I rushed to replace the tire, but I am a very small, not particularly strong person, so it was a slow going process. \n\nAn older man in ragged clothes who smelled heavily of dirt and sweat approached me. My stomach dropped with dread. While I am generally not a cruel person and welcome interactions with people in unfortunate situations, being stuck as I was in ninety degree heat with drivers around me shouting angrily and honking, I wasn't in the most convenient position to help anyone. I didn't have any cash with me to give him, and I didn't know if I could handle a heart-wrenching conversation about how horrendous life can be or learning about the man's visions from God, if he had them. It wasn't kind of me, and in retrospect I am not proud of my feelings when he first approached. \n\nMy anxieties were unfounded, and unfair. The man said nothing to me. He bent down beside my ruined tire, and began removing it from the car. I have never been so moved by anything in my life. A person who I had unfairly feared, a man who was so much less fortunate than every luxury-vehicle driving heckler that drove by, was the only person who stopped to help me change my tire. There were tears in my eyes when I thanked him. \n\nWe talked for a little while; he'd been a teacher once. He didn't go into specifics about his current situation. I offered to take him to dinner, but he refused. He told me to drive safely, and then he walked away. I'm convinced this man was some kind of guardian angel. I'm so grateful to him.",

        "story": "One night in June, I went to the gym to burn off some excess energy and clear my head so I'd fall asleep more easily. I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. \n\nShe tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. \n\nThe anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece of my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. \n\nI told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. \n\nI went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall. I looked at my angry face in the mirror and wondered why I allowed such a pathetic person to upset me so greatly. She wasn't worth it.",

I thought it would be a responsible thing to do. I decided to run a full credit report on myself as I have never done one before. I never understood why my credit score was so low. I have always made payments on time, never kept a balance, and barely used my cards. \n\nWhen I saw the results, I was shocked. I had two credit cards that were basically maxed out that I never knew about. I called the company that said I had accounts there and they said payments were being made on them so it doesn't seem to be fraud and I should ask people I know. \n\nSo, it turns out my own parent had falsely opened the cards under my name. I had 12,000 in credit card debt because of that associated with my name. And this is on top of my student loans! \n\nI was so upset and hurt by this. I forced her to find a way to pay it back and get it off my name. Eventually she did. I am still hurt and weary of it all.",

I had just sat down with her around my birthday, and while she mentioned having back pain, she was still sharp as a knife and not sick. \n\nI have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. \n\nWhen I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)\n\nAt the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier. I liked him, too. \n\nNow her children are planning to sell her house, and I'm a little nervous. I've never had a new neighbor so close before.",

I was then only six years old. My father proposed that i should be admitted into a school in class on the next day. I felt very excited i could not think of anything else. I was always thinking about the school, the teachers, as i watched on TV. I could not even sleep well that night. \n\nThe next morning my mother woke me early in the morning, she washed me very well, combed my hair and dressed me in new clothes. Then i had breakfast and started for school with my father. He took me to the nearest CFB primary school at 9:30 am. The school was not very far from our home, so we walked all the way, it took us about 30 minutes to get to the school. \n\nWhen i stepped into the school compound with my father i was somewhat afraid. I saw many student s on the school campus, some were playing, some where talking to each other. Finding myself in a new environment my heart started to beat, at first my father took me to the headmaster's room and requested him to admit me in first grade, i was nervous but his smiling face and and gentle eyes put me to ease. He asked me my name and i answered him. then he pointed me to a letter chart and asked me to say some letters. I could say them all because my mother taught me how to say it at home. Then he became very pleased at me and admitted me to first grade, then he called Ms Fatema the first grade teacher to take me to class. \n\nWhen i entered the class all the students in the class where staring at me, i felt a bit nervous once again to see the new faces, i sat down and at my leisure period, all my classmate started playing in the field, i felt very lonely and was loitering here and there, then they invited me to join them, i started playing, i felt myself like a free bird flying in the open sky. \n\nMy school ends at 12pm, my mother was at the gate to receive me. I leapt into her arms she kissed me and caught me in her arms. That was how i spent my first day of school. I left the school with a new experience and a cheerful mind. I shall never forget that day as long as i live.",

Without it I simply couldn't get paid. \n\nAnyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was overheating during my late night gaming sessions. \n\nAt the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. \n\nAnyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelope of money. At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. \n\nBut she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes. I was so grateful and thankful that people who loved and cared for me came through and went the extra mile for this. \n\nMy family isn't rich, so I know them giving up their hard earned money to help me out was big. Not saying we're poor, but we're not rich enough where we can just give away money without a care in the world. \n\nMy mom gave me a big hug and in that moment I felt the deepest amount of gratitude I ever experienced in my entire life. From the bottom of my heart I was truly deeply thankful. \n\nLater on I got together with my brothers and sisters that helped out, throwing them a party in their honor.

We found out she was not taking her medicine. She had entered into a psychotic state and it ended up taking 5 weeks before she could be released. She changed hospitals twice. \n\nI do not live where my mother does so I had to take time off work and spend a lot of time traveling. It was unbelievably exhausting. I did, however, develop a lot of friendships with her caretakers. \n\nIn the end she made huge progress, thankfully. However we are all concerned the issue will return. She is home now and doing ok but she may never be the same. Now she is doing group therapy weekly. Additionally she is back on meds that should work. \n\nI am back to work now and do not visit as much. I used to feel guilty but at this point I am beyond tired.",

        "story": "On July 9, 2019 I moving in with my Celia. This is kinda weird, because this is the first time I have ever moved in with a partner. I have had partners where we would spend 10 straight nights together, but we never reached the point where we had a dresser or permanent spot for clothes/ accessories. Walking through the door was such a rush of excitement and washing away of nerves to see the place I will be living in finally. \n\nIt is crazy to be moving all the way across the country to chase down a relationship, but this is a crazy amazing opportunity. I'm so grateful that I decided to go off and take this risk as well as my parents supporting it. Their contribution to make this happen really makes it all possible. The sadness of really having my friends and family so far gone, is at least now not present, because of my focus on the now. \n\nIt's so reassuring to see Celia's perkiness and hear the positivity in her voice. It is such a reaffirmation of the decision to watch her show me her place that she has shown me so much before but only through her phone. It is midday and it is hot up here. That doesn't get in the way of just pressing her body so tightly to the side of mine as she talks about each room. The heat is like melting us together and I feel that close to her. Just energy of joy is bounding through my body. \n\nEach part of the tour is revealing a part of my future, however long or short it is. As the day goes on, I still feel like a guest in the house, but that feeling is slowly riding away. Celia prepared a wonderful salad for us for dinner, which is just not her thing. It was great though, because it was her way of going out of her way to make this a great first day. Washing the dishes with her really made me feel closer and more part of the homeness that I hope to settle into. \n\nFinding a good groove to sit in felt like I was making a long term investment. While she laid under my arm it placed over her like a puzzle piece fitting in. It feels like the right decision and that this is going to be a positive experience no matter how it ends.",

I told her sure and gave her the keys. \n\nShe came back to work after her lunch and gave me my keys and we went about our day. I left work that day and went out to my car.

I stood there dumbfounded thinking \"how did this happen?\" and I called my friend and asked her if she knew anything about. \n\nShe laughed, and told me \"Happy Birthday\" that she had bought me a new tire for my car for my Birthday that was coming. I was so surprised and touched, that I burst into tears. She is an amazing friend, and I am blessed to have her in my life!",

I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. \n\nMy plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. \n\nShe is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been her and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. \n\nShe is adjusting well to her new school schedule and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance. I guess I will make it, it will be starting all over with her, and I am scared, but she thinks she is ready, and that is more of what matters.",

However, my Mom is the same way. She is always posting pictures any time we spend family time together, like playing a board game or something like that. \n\nI've asked her why she does it and that I would really rather not be blasted on social media if I am just chilling at home, but she just always gets mad and says okay she won't do it anymore. Am I wrong for not wanting to be put on social media when I am just chilling at home? \n\nAt this point, I just expect it when out in public, and never say anything.

We do activism in our community for lgbtq rights and have been disowned by half our family. \n\nI went to the local humane society the other day to check out a dog. I brought along my kid to make sure they were compatible and comfortable with each other. The dog I was originally looking at was way too timid and not comfortable so they brought out a different one that fit our household needs, as we also have a cat. It went great! The dog and kid got along. The dog was timid at first but warmed up after like 2 minutes and the kid knows how to approach and pet gently as we've been training with her since she was 6 months. \n\nThey said they couldn't release her just yet and to come back 2 days (today) from now. I wanted to have my partner meet the dog first so it fit well in our schedule anyway. When we got to the shelter the same person was working and took us to a different room. We waited for about 10 minutes until she came back and said there was a problem. \n\nThey had received 2 anonymous calls saying we weren't in the right place to adopt an animal. No name or anything left so they don't know who it was. They apologized profusely and said they couldn't give us the dog, but that there was no other red flags and they didn't get a bad vibe from us. They said they would email their manager to reconsider but they likely won't hear back until tomorrow. \n\nWe've had smear campaigns against us because of our activism, mostly calling us groomers, and I've been afraid they would call cps on us but I never expected them to call the humane society. I'm just totally baffled and deflated. We likely will be able to adopt the dog, but the fact someone would call to prevent it, I can't believe it. \n\nIf we are able to adopt the dog, her name will be Biscuit.",

I can make him laugh. \n\nToday he laid down on the bed for a while to get a break from sitting while gaming. So I went to kiss him, and as I got up, I took off his left sock and took it with me. He was so baffled that I'd do something like that for literally no reason that he started laughing, and his laughter is sunshine. \n\nToday we're taking my old, broken table to recycling, it was replaced by the nice, prettier, sturdy table his parents bought for us.

I have been quite lonely for what feels like most of my entire life, but I was lucky enough to meet this guy in one of my classes a couple of weeks or so ago who is very nice and actually seems to have some sort of interest in me. We've especially been talking more this week, and I was so happy because he asked for my number a couple days ago. \n\nToday when we were talking towards the end of class, though, I had mentioned that a couple things I really like are photography and hiking. One thing he asked was about which trail was my favorite, and when I told him, he said he really liked that one too because it was pretty close and he enjoyed going mountain biking there. Eventually, he said that he would love to take me there this weekend, because I had mentioned that I didn't really have any plans. I said that sounded like it would be super fun and that I'd be happy to go with him, and by the end of our chat, he said he would call me later so we could work out our plans. \n\nFast forward to when I was at home, and I was so nervous once again for when he would call me because it's actually our first time talking on the phone and doing something outside of school. When he did call, my heart was practically pounding, but I was able to answer it on time. He's picking me up at 11 in the morning tomorrow, and I think I'm more excited than I've ever been. \n\nI wasn't so sure what to make of it, but he actually called it \"our date\" while we were on the phone, so I cannot get that out of my head now. I already have some nice memories from that specific trail we're going on, and it now means even more to me than ever that I'm actually going on my first date ever there. \n\nI never would've expected something like this to happen in my life even a month or so ago (especially because I didn't even know him very well at all then), and I thought I would just get through high school being almost completely alone and maybe meet someone special in my adult life if I'm lucky, but I guess things really can get better!",
